                <p>
                    TODAY IS THE DAY!
                    Beyond the excitement that today brings for my coding journey I got to work on finishing the lesson from yesterday.
                    I debugged a number guessing game and fixed the typos, missing values and selectors.
                    Overall it wasn't really difficult, just new in the sense that looking at the debug console and walking through the program and seeing what and where was going wrong was super foreign and a tad uncomfortable.
                    Once I did sort of get use to it though, it became a decent amount easier.
                    You can take your own personal look at the game <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/js-foundations/understanding-errors/index.html">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd like to say that these last 100 days have been quite the journey.
                    I've had lots of days where I felt pumped and excited to work on certain parts of my lessons and projects.
                    And plenty of days where I honestly felt like I did not have the energy or will to push on through.
                    But here I am on the other end of the challenge!
                    I've done it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those good days were mostly when I was engrossed in my work and typically styling things with css, building the pages and so on.
                    There was just something about it that cause time to fly by, and I've had this experience numerous times in creative acts such as graphic design and video editing.
                    Over the last couple weeks roughly since the halfway point I hit a wall of what to me felt extremely boring learning.
                    Sometimes there would be the odd few lessons that jumped out as enjoyable but for the most part it was mind numbing to read so much about these important topics I would have to know to progress.
                    And that was real hard to motivate myself through, and I mean real hard.
                    I'm currently in a place where I'm out of work, looking for another job, perusing content creation again, and seeing where my coding could fit in.
                    And I really don't know where or what I could be doing with my skills, albeit very minimal as they are.
                    I've had some ideas to try getting into creating maybe mods, or a game or something that would spark more inspiration from me.
                    But I have yet to take that leap of faith into trying it out.
                    Barrier to entry can be really daunting in the face of day to day enjoyment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this amount of time, these 100 days, I can confidentially say I am tired, lol.
                    Being this consistent has never been something I easily did, or took lightly.
                    And it is definitely a tough challenge, my brain often would want to shut down(space out for awhile) 10 minutes in, or I would re-read the same sentence a few times over until I retained some essence of it.
                    I even resorted to putting the paragraphs into a TTS output so I would be able to comprehend / digest it without the shut down mentioned previously.
                    But only after I started reading it out loud to myself maybe as early as day 25(could be earlier, hard to keep track) did I try out TTS.
                    I am happy I can finally take a good break, but I also do not want to discontinue entirely, I want to try some things and see what I take to, if any of it grips me.

                    This was my experience with the <em>#100DaysOfCode</em> Challenge, Started August 1st 2022, Ending November 8th 2022.
                    All 100 Posts are here to skim through, and see how my progress went.
                    Slow in some parts, quick in others.

                <p>
                    Today I started on the Understanding Errors lesson on The Odin Project.
                    After reading what the lesson had to offer I started on the assignment, but ran out of time due to the reading taking up the majority of my time for today.
                    The lesson itself taught about reference errors and how when you get these errors it tells you information about what line in the javascript document is halting the overall program.
                    And on top of that there is alo a part of the error called a stack trace, which shows you where in what function/call it halted in and shows each line reference.
                    So happy for the last day of this challenge tomorrow, I'm going to keep today short and talk with you tomorrow!

                <p>
                    I went on and completed the Problem Solving lesson, which was more educational in the way to think about solving a problem with code, or just tackling tough problems in general.
                    During this lesson it talked about a FizzBuzz function that when given a number would output to the console every number up to the provided one, and replace all numbers cleanly divisible by 3 with Fizz and 5 with Buzz, and if both then FizzBuzz.
                    You can check out my answer <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/js-foundations/problem-solving/index.html">here</a>.
                    This lesson really went into depth on pseudocode and the importance of being able to explain the problem, how you want to solve it, and what you need for each step of the way in plain english and not in code.
                    For the assignment I read a portion of the 1st link, moved on to the second link which was to an hour+ video explaining the importance of pseudocode and how it is more likely the skill you will utilize more often that the actual coding skills.
                    Regardless of which language you decide to write your program in, knowing what you need in terms of input, need to solve, and what output type, you can move this line of thinking to any language or intermediary thanks to wonderful resources like google.
                    I enjoyed this lesson and had a good time with it.
                    Looking forward to my last 2 days!

                    Today I completed the fundamentals part 3 lesson, which surprises me because it was so much reading.
                    And to be honest I got far enough into the lesson where I just decided to look at the assignment section.
                    Lo and behold once I saw the challenges I needed to accomplish I thought to myself, "Oh, I'm not going to continue reading these (like 6 different articles) if I can solve these.".
                    So I gave them a try and as they appeared they were very simple and I easily completed them.
                    It is a fact that reading the articles is what takes up the most time for me.
                    Take a look at the console for <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/js-foundations/part-3-1/index.html">this page right here</a>.
                    The first custom function assigned was a basic "take a num and output it + 7", the second being similar but taking in two arguments and outputting the product of them.
                    The third was a function that would capitalize the first letter in a string, regardless of if the string was already in all caps, lowercase, or a mixture.
                    So my solution to it was to force the entire string to be lowercase, then assign the string to itself but .replace() the first letter (.charAt(0)) with that same letter but .toUpperCase().
                    Really simple, and I only feel this way as I have had a few assignments that made me accomplish this on freeCodeCamp.
                    I love using both resources!
                    The last function was to return the last letter of a string, again super simple, just <em>return str.charAt(str.length - 1)</em> and it was accomplished.
                    Feeling good about this, the reading puts my head to sleep and makes it hard to focus but when actively solving problems I find so much enjoyment from the process, mind you, if I know what pieces of information to look for and how to use them.
                    I only have 3 days left of this challenge and that alone is nuts, may my interest in programming / coding never cease!
                    Chat tomorrow!

                    Today had me working on and completing the JavaScript Developer Tools lesson on The Odin Project.
                    It was like 50% review of things I already am familiar with, but for the sake of making sure that I wasn't missing anything I went through the other 50% and filled in the gaps.
                    Lots of changing css values, classes, and page layout.
                    Then simulating a mobile device through the dev tools(chrome).
                    Finally ending off with debugging methods for javascript within the dev tools.
                    That included: break points; seeing your functions be processed one line at a time to catch errors using the step into next function call button, with more similar buttons like step over next function call; the scope pane which displays currently defined global variables in one place; watch expressions.
                    Overall I thought this lesson was really boring, but a must, to make sure I had the basic knowledge of this lesson down at least a little.
                    Moving on to tomorrow.

                    I finished up fundamentals pt 2 today.
                    By first completing the reading for conditionals and then working through the exercise assignments.
                    The first was to simple add together to variables with the value of 1 for each, output would be 2. This was easy.
                    The next exercise was to check if a prompted value you pass to a function would result in true if that value was equal or greater than 10.
                    The third exercise had me assigning math equations to variables, some of which directly referred to other pre stated variables.
                    And finally the fourth had me make a Sentence out of 6 variables, <em>"Hello! My name is " + fullName + " and I am " + age + " years old."</em>.
                    I ran into some quirks with the code being funky and acting weird but after some struggling (with the right output mind you) I got the exercise to recognize my correct answer.
                    That does it for me today.
                    5 Days left! Take care!

                    I continued with my reading today, and moved onto the mdm conditionals test your skills page.
                    I made it down to conditional #3 but haven't completed it yet.
                    But before this, the reading had me attempt to get some code working for an updating calendar that would display the amount of days in each month in a visual way.
                    Meaning it drew rectangular boxes with the respective number labeled inside.
                    I couldn't get this to work on my own document but the mdn doc had in-browser code editors to use and it worked there.
                    I'm happy to get to finally see how JS interacts with html directly, even at such a low level.
                    The next mdn active learning lesson was to change the background and text color of a select element using the dropdown menu.
                    And for this one they wanted it to use a switch statement, so I did just that and got it working.
                    The first conditional tester was to write a if...else statement that if a variable contained a known string of our choosing it would display a response.
                    So I did just that, using <em>includes()</em> to search for 'summer' from the var season.
                    Conditionals number 2 was to write and if...else statement to detect if a var was true or false (in the practice problem, it was a machine being on or off, true or false).
                    Then if the machine was off it would output a response to turn the machine on.
                    On the other end, if the machine was on it would go into a nested if...else statement.
                    This statement would check to see what the var score was and depending on its value would output a variety of different responses.
                    Score below 0 and above 100? Response.
                    Score from 0-19? Response.
                    Score from 20-39? Response... and so on.
                    I finally got to the 3rd problem which was to swap out the nested if...else statement with a switch statement.
                    I got stuck a little and ran out of time, so here I am writing this.
                    Also only 6 days left in this challenge! That's crazy!
                    Take care, I'll chat with you tomorrow!

                <p>
                    Today I continued reading through the articles from fundamentals part 2 on The Odin Project.
                    Been going over the operators such as <em>&&</em> and <em>||</em>.
                    Being refreshed on if...else statements and switch statements.
                    As well as the Ternary operator, being a shorthand if statement that relies on a true or false output from the condition.
                    <em>condition ? < if true code here > : < if false code here ></em> is what it looks like in its most basic form.
                    It was just a lot of reading today so I'll continue with more tomorrow.

                    I went back onto The Odin Project and found myself 30minutes into reading about comparisons and logical operators.
                    Reading this kind of material puts my head to sleep and makes it increasingly more difficult to focus and retain any of this information.
                    It's almost as if I have no interest in this topic, and there might be some truth to this.
                    Regardless, I'm struggling with && and || operators, more so the former.
                    Some of the material on the resources TOP provided just confuses me, like why does <em>alert( alert(1) && alert(2) );</em> output 1, and undefined.
                    Like what about it makes undefined appear?
                    Perhaps the first alert() is triggered as falsy so it outputs that but its another alert so it outputs the value, then undefined?
                    I'm really not sure, but I'm not enjoying my time today doing this.
                    I may need to think of other fields I can explore with coding, make it more interactive, and useful in application.
                    I'm feeling a lot of apathy.
                    So that is all from me today.

                <p>
                    I had some more difficulties with todays challenge too.
                    I don't think I have a deep grasp on being able to solve basic problems, or complex ones that involve arrays.
                    Definitely a weak spot for me and my knowledge and capabilities.
                    I have a feeling I may need to go back into TOP and just brute force the lessons in, so I can hopefully learn the problem solving skills I require.
                    Todays challenge was to check a num against an array and see if the num is equal to or larger than the array index number, essentially we need to see where the given num would fit in the array.
                    It had me sort the array which involved something I am not comfortable with or even confident using, arrow functions.
                    Once the array was sorted from smallest to largest I needed a for loop to iterate through it.
                    Then an if statement to check if the arr[i] was greater than or equal to the number provided.
                    If this was true it would return the i value to the output, if it was false it would continue until true.
                    If the num provided ended up being larger then all values in the array it would return the length of the array.
                    And I had such a hard time grasping the escape methods and how for loops properly work.
                    I was trying multiple if statements, and checking the index value ahead of i to see if it was less than, and all that.
                    I've hit a wall of what I can solve with my knowledge that contains a bunch of holes of misunderstandings.
                    Any way, I think I will go back onto TOP just to give it another chance, as it feels freeCodeCamp has surpassed my understanding, and leaves me lost.

                    Todays challenge was much harder than I anticipated.
                    To the point where I could not solve it myself and resorted to looking at the solutions from the hint page.
                    The goal of the challenge was to create a function that would intake values from an array, check if they are truthy or falsy and if they were truthy it would push it into a blank array to be outputted.
                    The problem I had was not looking into truthy and falsy, I tried every other method I could come up with to determine if a value was false or not and none of it really worked as I had hoped.
                    Then I find out you can just put a variable into an if statement and it will decide if that variable is true or false.
                    I had no memory of this being a thing, but it's so obvious now after the fact.
                    And I definitely learned something new, the hard way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regardless that was all I accomplished today, the struggle of solving a problem when the solution is right under your nose.
                    I'll try to be more diligent with researching terms used in these challenges from now on.

                <p>
                    Today my hour was taken up by two challenges, both being rather difficult for me.
                    Starting out, the "Title Case a Sentence" challenge had me doing just that.. making every letter in a string lowercase first and then having uppercase first letters, Like This Segment Of Text Right Here.
                    My method at first was to use a regex, which I didn't complete the lesson with but now looking back I could've made it work anyway.
                    I wanted the function to be the least amount of code possible for me, and having a regex was adding more.
                    So I ended up assigning the given string to itself with <em>.toLowerCase()</em>, then self assigning it <em>.split(" ")</em>.
                    Next I ran a for loop through it's length and self assigned each first letter to be upper case, the code looks like this <em>str[i] = str[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str[i].slice(1)</em>.
                    Then using <em>.join(" ")</em> to stitch the array of words together with spaces between them back into a string.
                    The <em>.split()</em> turned them into an array, separating them by the "spaces".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next up was "Slice and Splice", but without much of the first part.
                    The goal of this function is to take 2 arrays, and a index to add the first one into the second array.
                    making arr1 <em>[1,2,3]</em> go in between arr2[index] and the end of the array, in order.
                    I got this resolved and functioning by assigning <em>arr3 = [...arr2]</em> as to not mess with the original arr2, then let <em>x = arr3.splice(index)</em>.
                    I ran <em>arr3.splice(n)</em> next because it provides different outputs depending on if you assign it to a variable, or run it standalone, as it effects the "arr3" when used, but gives you the remaining when assigned.
                    Next I wrote two for loops, iterating through arr1 and x, arr1's loop pushed arr1[i] to the now spliced arr3(non assigned), the code looked like this <em>for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {arr3.push(arr1[i])}</em> while the second loop was pushing the effected array(x)'s values into arr3, code went like this <em>for (let j = 0; j < x.length; j++) {arr3.push(x[j]);}</em>.
                    After those completed all that was left was to return arr3, and it would now contain <em>arr3 == [4,1,2,3,5]</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, hard challenges but I feel happy they are done now!

                <p>
                    Today I ended up not needing to look at any of the hint solutions for the challenges!
                    I feel really good about that.
                    I confirmed the ending of a string with a function that took a str arg and checked the last target.length characters and compared it to the target, if that came up true it would output a boolean.
                    I Made a function that repeated a string as many times as the num arg instructed it to and outputted them concatenated together.
                    Next I created a function that that truncated a given string based on the num arg given, it would then append "..." if the string was longer than the num arg, if shorter it would simply output the full str arg with no adjustments.
                    The next one I had some difficulty with, but overall was eventually able to solve it.
                    I created a function that took an array arg and a function arg, somewhat like a callback.
                    It then needed to check the array for a digit that would pass a truth test from the given function.
                    Then once it found that arr[i] it would then return that number.
                    If it failed the function truth test it would return undefined.
                    Lastly for today, I made a function that tested if a passed argument was strictly a boolean, if it was it would output true, and if not, false.
                    Compared to the previous few, this one was quite quick, but I did get hung up on when I put "==" instead of "===" and a given "1" arg came up as true...
                    I laughed when I fixed that, so silly.
                    Any way, thank you for reading, I'll talk atcha tomorrow :)

                <p>
                    Today was actually different in some ways than the past few.
                    I started on Basic Algorithm Scripting, which had me testing my knowledge and skills against some challenges.
                    No hand holding, basic setup and telling you what it wants to have happen, then letting you run with that and solve it.
                    I completed 5 of them in the hour today, I think two of them, maybe three, I needed assistance with a particular part.
                    I got stuck mostly with remembering how to use some methods.
                    The first one was converting celsius to fahrenheit, solved that one quickly.
                    Reversing the string was the next and that was quite difficult as I forgot about the .split() method.
                    Which splits up a string into letters in an array, this method needed an empty string inside the ("") to work properly and I'm not sure why fully.
                    .reverse() was straight forward, and reversed the array.
                    Then .join(), which also required ("") to work.
                    I found the syntax for using these 3 methods really confusing when I was getting errors for the output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next was to Factorialize a number, and I had the hardest time with this one.
                    I ended up using recursion to make this lesson output the right answer, as I couldn't figure out the others on my own, or with help from the hint page.
                    I found the recursion method to be the most simple and intuitive.
                    The next challenge was to find the longest word in a string.
                    This one was fun, and difficult.
                    I used a solution that even the hint page didn't have.
                    I wound up using a regex to match() the str value <em>/\S+/gi</em> into an array.
                    Then I after getting super close to a working answer I got stuck and needed to look at the hint page.
                    Found where I went wrong when iterating over the array, it's always with the errors to do with .length but I had left an extra arr[i]<u>[j]</u> in the code.
                    Then finally on the last challenge I was returning the largest numbers in an array.
                    It provided me with an array of arrays with multiple numbers inside.
                    I was able to iterate through each arr[i][j] to set that value to the "highest" then compare it directly to the next number with an if statement.
                    Checking to see if it was higher than the highest, if it was it would be updated as the highest and once done iterating in the sub-array it would be put into output.push(highest).
                </p>
                <p>
                    That completes my days worth of coding, I like these challenges as they really make you struggle and once you solve the problem at hand it really feels rewarding.
                    Especially when you come up with an answer, such as the regex I did, and you feel over the moon at what you can do.
                    Talk atcha again tomorrow!

                    Another brief day, started out with using the delete keyword to remove object properties.
                    Then iterate through the keys of an object with a <em>for...in</em> statement.
                    That was an interesting one, as I could assign each value pair as a "index variable" for the for loop to iterate through.
                    Basically like an array it went from 0 till the end of the object, looking at each upper level object in the parent object.
                    The next lesson was learning about <em>Object.key()</em> which can display e.g. an array of values from within the object provided depending on what section of that object you notate.
                    Then last for this section I had to modify an array that was stored inside an object as a value pair.
                    This was difficult but only because I could'nt figure out why it was outputting "4" instead of the array of values I appended another value to.
                    Turned out I needed to run the operation on a separate line from the return statement, so <em>obj.data.values.push(value); return obj.data.values</em> was what I needed and what I did write, but a little scuffed compared to what worked, lol.
                    But yeah, I'm exhausted and find it hard to enjoy javascript.
                    Dunno where I should take my next steps towards.
                    I feel I keep forgetting so much useful info, but I suppose remembering everything isn't usual.
                    As I've read / heard something along the line of "developers rarely memorize everything, it ends up being about your research and problem solving skills."
                    I'll speak atcha tomorrow!

                    I'm going to be brief today, I went through a few lessons refreshing and challenging me to figure out what I've learned before but use it again now.
                    Got stuck on the first lesson for way to long, I was trying to do an extra for loop which was not needed as I could just use .indexOf() to search for a value inside of a nested array.
                    Next I learned about nested arrays more, and multi-dimensional arrays.
                    Adding key-value pairs to JS objects, modifying objects nested within an object.
                    Then finally at the end of my time today learned how to access property names with bracket notation, again all refreshing information but still needed!

                    Today I did as I expected yesterday and started the Basic Data Structures section on freeCodeCamp.
                    Went over some refresher material that I remember from the beginning of this cert. such as accessing array contents, pushing, popping, shifting, unshifting, splicing, and unsplicing them.
                    It was all pretty easy but I found a different solution to one of the lessons than the lesson hint would have wanted.
                    I found that cool that I was able to come up with a simple 1 line answer to the same problem that had a different one line answer being expected.
                    It let it pass as well which is likely why I'm so happy about it.
                    The answer I put was <em>newArr[num - 1] = [...arr];</em> which was in a while statement for <em>num >= 1</em>.
                    The answer in the hint was <em>newArr.push([...arr]);</em> while being more simple, yes, I found my answer to also fit the use-case, and really I was just proud of my learning and problem solving skills I've grown over these past 80+ days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than that, I didn't really have much trouble with this section, feeling pretty good about it all.
                    I'll be continuing this tomorrow as usual!
                    Speak with you then!

                    I got started today on the Debugging section from freeCodeCamp.
                    Refreshed on how to log to the console, with some new commands like <em>warn</em> and <em>clear</em>.
                    Then the rest of the courses were having me go over some typical debugging scenarios such as: Catching misspelled variable and function names; Catching unclosed parentheses, brackets, braces and quotes; Catching mixed usage of single and double quotes; Catching the use of assignment operators instead of an equality operator; Catching arguments passed in the wrong order when calling a function; Catching "Off By One Errors" when using indexing; Using caution when reinitializing variable inside a loop; And Preventing infinite loops with a valid terminal condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And to be fair these were all pretty easy to complete.
                    And for a day like today where I'm a little slow to get rolling this was a nice change of difficulty for me.
                    The prior lesson sections really covered the topics in this section fairly well, and I at least can do these with little to no issues.
                    Now I am extremely tired and this is all I am doing today, I will hit up the Basic Data Structures section tomorrow!
                    That outta be a hoot.

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 082:</b> <u><em>October 21st 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today I completed the Regular Expressions section (the one with all the lessons on regex creation).
                    Started out by learning about positive and negative lookahead syntax, <em>/(?=...)/</em> being the positive, and <em>/(?!...)/</em> being the negative variant.
                    They both look ahead into what the regex is searching for and makes sure that your matches meet those expectations.
                    Positive being it has it, negative being that it does not contain it.
                    At this point I had been supplementing my learning with youtube videos that explain these topics more in depth and it has been helping quite a lot.
                    I did this more later into the lessons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next lesson taught me about checking for a variety of possibilities when searching, so if I was looking for two people with the same last name but different first names I could match both of them together regardless.
                    In a very simplistic way though, <em>"Pumpkin Punching Penguin"</em> as a sample string could be matched like so <em>/P(umpk|engu|unch)ing?/</em> the <em>(...|...)</em> options give it "or" logic, and the "g?" takes it if it is present but if it is not it will be ignored.
                    Then I hit a snag, a tough lesson with a tough challenge.
                    When trying to pull 3 repeats of "42" from a string I started to need a thing called capture groups.
                    <em>/(x)(y)(z)/</em> each "( )" was capturing the insides as its own temporary variable.
                    You can access these temporary variables in the regex in the order they show up.
                    So <em>/(1)(2)(3)/</em> would be the order.
                    I used this new technique to pull just 2 extra "42"s from the string like so <em>/^(\d+) \1 \1$/</em>.
                    This was one of the lessons needing a video to explain more in-depth, I had been forgetting about the caret <em>^</em> and $ that indicate the start and end of my regex match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I learned how to further use captures and in addition with the <em>.replace()</em> method on strings.
                    This is where I learned how to use the dollar sign syntax in strings.
                    Remember those temporary variables from the captures I mentioned earlier?
                    Well they can be added back into a string using their indicator number and the "$".
                    So inside of the .replace(REGEX, "$1 $2 $3") from earlier would be "x y z".
                    After that I completed the last lesson in this section by removing the whitespace from a string, using captures and $ syntax.
                    By this point it was fairly easy to do, and the previous lessons were more difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that does it for today, I feel I have a decent understanding on regex's now and that wasn't so bad, very interactive.
                    Turning out to be a little fun :D

                <p>
                    Today I didn't really do much, or get very far.
                    But I did learn how to match whitespace and non-whitespace characters using <em>\s</em> and <em>\S</em> in a regex.
                    I got to specify how many upper and lower numbers I wanted to match to, using <em>/x{2,5}</em> meaning if the input has 2-5 x's it will match it.
                    I used <em>/x{4,}/</em> with no other value next to "4" to get the response of; give any matches with four or more of "x" in it.
                    Also got to specify how many exact matches using <em>/xy{3}z/</em> meaning I would only get "xyyyz" which outputs true with .test(), the "xyyyz" would be the only match, if given "xyyyyz" it would result in a fail of a pass.
                    Then to wrap it up, learned how to express a difference in same language words and have them still match.
                    Such as "flavor" & "flavour", the regex being <em>/flavou?r/</em> where the "u?" means; look for 0 or more of this letter and match it.
                    If the input doesn't have the "u" contained that meets the zero criteria and pushes as a match, and vice versa.
                    Still requiring the rest of the regex match to succeed to actually pass it as a match.
                    Otherwise it would fail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all for me today, happy 19 days and counting!

                <p>
                    Today I went over the lessons teaching me more about regex operators and what more of them do.
                    I learned about lazy matching, using the "?" operator, allowing for the regex to find the bare minimum needed to complete the match.
                    Used the caret operator "^" to find strings at the begging of a statement only.
                    Found out how to do the opposite, finding a string at the end of a statement only by using "$" operator.
                    Used the "\w" operator using shorthand to find [a-zA-Z0-9_] within a statement.
                    Also used the "\W" to exclude those from the regex output.
                    Then learned about "\d" for finding all digits/numerical characters, and "\D" for excluding them/finding all non-digit characters.
                    Then finally did the last lesson of the day which had me using my new knowledge to restrict possible username options.
                    I had the help of some youtube videos throughout today to assist me in understanding on a deeper level how to put these to use together, and it was quite confusing at first, but after a bit it began to make more sense.
                    After finding a solution to the lessons task I went through it diligently to understand what it was answering in code to the lessons requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I definitely do not think if left alone with the last lesson in front of me I would have been able to figure it out.
                    Maybe if I had better notes of all of the operators I could have, but I needed my hand held a little to get through this one.
                    I feel I have a better understanding coming out of it now, and I think I should probably do some practice assignments on this topic.
                    That is all I had time for today, I had another hike doing the same trail I did yesterday but this time I was alone, and I completed it in 51 minutes.
                    This seems to give me mental energy to tackle my lessons for the day, and I love that!
                    I also have 20 more days left of this challenge and I am so proud of myself for being able to stick to this so well.
                    I'm sure my html / css skills are getting rusty by now but one step at a time.
                    I'll catch you tomorrow!

                    After my hike today, and following shower, I had so much energy left in my head that going through these lessons really was fast and I had no issues, minus a few typos but those happen from time to time, lol.
                    I will continue on this path tomorrow and will catch up with you then!

                <p>
                    Today I started my learning while being exceptionally tired, way before it's even past 4pm.
                    Dunno why, I suppose I woke up like this.
                    Anyway I started on TOP withe a MDN article in the strings section of part 2, after that I was super bored and went over to freeCodeCamp to see if I could wake up my brain on there.
                    Needless to say it worked and I got a few lessons done.
                    I learned how to define a constructor function within a class object, then used that knowledge, and some youtube videos which helped explain the concepts better, to write some getter and setters to control access to the object I needed to write.
                    It was all about converting temperature from fahrenheit to celsius, and being able to call specific bits of it.
                    In the next lesson I created a module script, which is way more simple than it sounds.
                    I simply was taught how to add the script tag into an html index, then put its type="module" and its src to the provided filename.
                    Really basic stuff but the next lessons will dive deeper into this, and I'm looking forward to learning how to actually implement my knowledge into real projects, real tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have an idea for a project I want to build, and as a way of explaining where I'm at with JavaScript: I have a decent amount of lego blocks, and I somewhat know how to use them in small groups, but I have absolutely no clue how to put them together to make something cool, like a spaceship.
                    Weird analogy I know but it really does feel like I can learn all of the pieces to this language but I still don't know how to make it cross communicate with an html file for instance, or even css.
                    And to accomplish my goal for the project I want to build, I need that knowledge.
                    At this current time I feel so bored as I am unable to put this new knowledge into practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all from me today, I will catch up with you tomorrow!

                <p>
                    So today I went back onto The Odin Project to continue the JavaScript fundamentals over there.
                    I completed part 1 and started on part 2.
                    You can see what I did <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/js-foundations/part-1-3/index.html">here</a>.
                    Like with most of TOP's lessons it relies on a lot of reading and so that's what took up most of my time today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Happy to be working on this again though, I needed to step back from freeCodeCamp and go back over the basics in JavaScript or else I will keep struggling to keep up.
                    Both resources together end up being a wonderful combination.
                    That's all for today, catch you tomorrow!

                <p>
                    Today I went through concise object literal declarations, using object property shorthand.
                    And writing a concise declarative function with ES6.
                    I think the way I'm currently learning this stuff is not the right way to go for the best results.
                    It is entirely repetitive and boring.
                    Either it's me not being able to pick up this information as quickly as it dishes it out on freeCodeCamp, or the method of learning isn't the right way for me.
                    I might need something more interactive, but I should also likely head back onto TOP and see if I can get through that any easier now that I have some experience with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway that is all I'm doing today, have a wonderful weekend!

                <p>
                    I completed a few lessons today, and I've been having some issues with comprehending what it is asking me to accomplish.
                    Sometimes it's the vocabulary but that is easy enough to look up.
                    I don't know what it is fully but I'm definitely not use to arrow functions yet as they are throwing me a little bit when they come up.
                    Also solving the problems and comprehending them in the first place has been tough.
                    But I'm taking it one step at a time, and looking at the solution if I get really stuck and walking myself through it.
                    Any way, today has been a lot of destructuring, from arrays to objects and in general it hasn't been the most fun.
                    I'm itching for a lesson/project that leads me to build something as these lessons are not scratching that itch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How cool is it that I've made it to 3/4ths of the way through this challenge.
                    I am excited to finish it up and get to work on trying some other things, I might even continue into 100+ days.
                    Never the less, I'll continue more tomorrow!

                <p>
                    I got started today with the ES6 section on freeCodeCamp.
                    Compared scopes between <em>var</em> and <em>let</em> keywords.
                    Learned how to mutate an array declared with const, as well as how to prevent mutation with <em>Object.freeze()</em>.
                    Found out another way to make functions, Arrow functions!
                    Learned how to use them with multiple arguments and even the <em>rest</em> parameter, "...args".
                    Also the spread operator to evaluate arrays in-place.
                    So an arrays values can be used as individual arguments or inputs of sorts.
                    Then lastly I learned how to destructure an object assignment to allow assigning variables to it easier.
                    E.g. you have an object with multiple value pairs, you can use <em>const { value1, value2... } = label</em> to simply define variables for each value pair in accordance with the label.
                    So label.value1 = value1's value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's tje best I can explain that currently, but that wraps up my learning for today.
                    I'm really satisfied with freeCodeCamp's lessons so far, they are tough but not crazy abstract, and very digestible.
                    Obviously not without its issues but that's water under the bridge.
                    I catch up with you tomorrow with some more ES6 lesson info!

                <p>
                    Today I learned how to create random: fractions, whole numbers, within a range.
                    Also how to parse integers from a value, use it in a function with a radix(in this case base 2, so turning a binary input into a value).
                    I learned the Conditional (Ternary) Operator, and how to use multiple in one function.
                    Then I used recursion to create a countdown function, then to finish up 100% of this basic JavaScript section from freeCodeCamp I used recursion again to create a range of numbers between two givin input values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow I will be starting the ES6 section which has 29 parts.
                    Also tomorrow I have a meeting with my boss and I will be out a larger portion of the day driving to pick up my mom.
                    So I will try to get myself doing this early in the day but thats iffy.
                    Might end up being an end of the day thing again, but we'll see.
                    Bye for now!

                    I was unable to get as far as I had hoped, but I got through the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj/profile-lookup-js/index.html">Profile Lookup</a> lesson, but just barely.
                    It was really tough to keep track of what everything was doing and what I needed to get done in the right order.
                    Knowing if I needed an <em>else</em> statement apart of the 1st <em>if</em> statement took me awhile to see that I did not.
                    And I think I kept confusing the syntax for accessing an array of objects with properties with the output being wrong, changing it a lot of times to get the output to be correct.
                    I turned out that I had made an unnecessary statement of <em>.hasOwnProperty(thing) === true</em> when it itself accepts the condition if only its true, so I needed that as a nested if statement.
                    Another issue was how to put the array[i][value] or array[i].value into use.
                    Syntax and confusion based on outputs was the issue.
                    Ultimately after working at this for over an hour, and looking stuff up, I had to look at the answer as I felt I was SO close to solving it, and I truly was.
                    This lead me to deep dive into what was happening in my version of the function to realize my mistakes and errors.
                    As well as recognize way I could have done it.
                    I had no clue there was an <em>in</em> statement, similar to for and while / if and else.
                    I never learned it, and for now I'll wait on doing so as it's a tad beyond me right now.
                    especially after the day I've had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To say it without having to deeply say it, I had an issue with a boss of mine at work, and decided it was best for me to leave and head home, rather than sit in my excessive stress and anxiety.
                    Ultimately I am having a meeting this thursday with my other boss in regards to the situation and my future at my current company.
                    I feel confident to say I'm ready to move on from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll have a lot of time tomorrow so I intend on working through a lot of my lessons, maybe I'll finish?
                    Maybe not, we'll see!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 071:</b> <u><em>October 10th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today I learned about using <em>while</em> and <em>for</em> loops.
                    Counting backwards and iterating through an array.
                    How to nest <em>for</em> loops and use <em>do...while</em> loops.
                    Ending on a lesson teaching me about function recursion vs loops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have to say that the recursion lesson was the hardest for me to grasp out of these, and I still don't fully grasp the solution to the lesson all the way in my head.
                    The actual premise of what recursion is and how to create a function that does this makes sense.
                    But the logic behind the second step is a lot harder to wrap my head around right now.
                    It might be due to the lack of mental energy but it was tough none the less.
                    I'm exhausted from my day at work, and don't have much steam left in me so thats it for me today.
                    Check back in tomorrow where I will tackle more problems, and if I'm lucky, I might finish this entire section of freeCodeCamp.
                    That is section 01/10.

                    Todays lesson was really difficult.
                    It was to build a function that updates a <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj/record-collection-js/index.html">record collection</a>.
                    I don't know how to show off what it does fully, but I'm linking it here anyway, it was a lot of effort so I want to keep track of it / my solution.
                    I took me over an hour to figure out how to do it, and to remember all the pieces.
                    Looked up what ever I could think of to get the problem on its way to being solved and at my cutoff point was able to get it to pass on freeCodeCamp.
                    I'm mentally drained and a little bit saddened by my inability to solve it better.
                    Or even, faster.
                    That was all I was able to complete today. Chat tomorrow!

                    After being out all day, I got home and got back at it with JavaScript.
                    I learned how to use dot notation and bracket notation with objects and their respective properties to search for said properties.
                    And the differences between the two (notations) and why I should use one over the other depending on the situation.
                    Meaning I can search an object (which I also learned how to make) for a specific property or append / remove them.
                    Using functions to mass test objects for properties and so on.
                    Also started touching on nested objects that have, of course, objects within objects as "properties".
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's really about it for today, I'm quite exhausted so I will get more done tomorrow :)

                <p>
                    Today I went through; adding a default option to switch statements, multiple identical options in a switch statement, using switch statements in place of if else statements as they can simplify things for specific tasks, returning boolean values from functions, and making a counting cards function.
                    The last one was the more difficult one, as I needed to make it check for a bunch of different values provided on a visual table in the lesson.
                    Then add 1 or subtract 1 based on the type of card, then output that number and a string of "Bet" or "Hold".
                    I really enjoyed this one.
                    It was difficult enough as I'm not confident in my abilities but it came to me easy enough that I didn't hit any major road blocks.
                    I'm having a good time with these lessons, in the grand scheme of things.
                    And I look forward to more!
                    I'll be busy tomorrow with more driving so I'll likely get home late, hopefully I'm able to keep up!

                   I kept working through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript cert.
                   Learning about more equation operators and a bunch of other things.
                   for example the <em>&&</em>(And) and <em>||</em>(Or) operators which allow for more complex function decision making to happen.
                   e.g. <em>val >= 5 && val <= 10</em> when given a value of "more than or equal to 5 <u>and</u> less than or equal to 10" results in moving through that specifying if/else if statement.
                   Then <em>val = 5 || val = 10</em> would output into that if/else if statement only if the val was 5 <u>or</u> 10.
                   Very simple and mostly useless examples but I still need real world use of these before I can give a deep understanding of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hinted at it in the above paragraph but I also learned about <em>If</em> & <em>Else If</em> statements.
                    And the logical order of using them in a function.
                    I also was exposed to <em>Switch</em> statements.
                    Which I might add, was horribly explained as to how it fits into the code that I would write.
                    I ended up needing to watch a youtube video that explained them to understand their placement and basic usage.
                    With the essential info filled in I was able to pick up the slack of the rest of the lesson.
                    The lesson then made more sense but as a "freshie" it was not adequate to explain it.
                    I was initially unable to tell if it was a custom function named switch or anything that would decern that it belongs within a function vs the formula to make one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond that small difficulty the other lessons were overall fine and I got through them at a good pace.
                    The gold code lesson had me make if/else if statements in a function that would output bases on a par value and strokes value a string that would tell you the "verbal" score of those two values.
                    Only thing that was weird about it was that most of the conditions for the statements needed to be a <em>strokes <u><=</u> (equation)</em>.
                    The <em><=</em> doesn't all the way sit right with me as I felt the way it was, previously before corrected, defined was suitable enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all for today, catch ya tomorrow!

                    Today was a little hard to concentrate on the lessons.
                    I found some of the explainer paragraphs on a few lessons to be a little lack luster.
                    As well as they seem to be really heavily "holding your hand" during each lesson.
                    Yes they introduce you to the topics, explain what they are and how it works (on a simple level) but then they have you change 1 thing in the code to result in the tests passing.
                    Which really didn't do it for me.
                    I want to really work with the problem, play with the concept and build e.g functions from the ground up that incorporate this new information into them, fluidly.
                    That is how I feel confident learning these things, repetition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I only completed a few lessons I did learn about creating a function to add and remove a value to and from an array while outputting the removed value.
                    Also learned about if and else if statements with function conditions.
                    Still fuzzy on the concrete way of using it but the general idea is there in my head.
                    That's all for today!

                    Hello! Today I continued working through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript cert, went from 28% to 50%.
                    In that jump in progression I learned some new things and refreshed my knowledge on some stuff I have a little experience with.
                    Firstly being Arrays, mostly review at this time on how arrays work but really what I was learning was how to interact with them with JavaScript.
                    The usual <em>.pop()</em> <em>.push()</em> <em>.shift()</em> <em>.unshift()</em> and so on.
                    After seeing that it's basically the same structure layout as I am familiar with in Python this was easy enough to pick up again.
                    The next bit was about creating functions, returning values, and using custom arguments within said functions.
                    This also included learning about Global variables vs local ones within and outside of functions.
                    Local variables being specific to the "local ecosystem" of the function and global being.. well, global to the entire program / script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's really all I had time to learn today, and I am liking freeCodeCamp's way of teaching a little bit more right at this moment, as a way to get use to working in JavaScript then I feel once I have more confidence I'll dive into TOP to learn a deeper understanding of it.
                    Both have their strengths and weaknesses for my learning style but I'm enjoying the journey :) Chat with you tomorrow!

                <p>
                    Today I decided to shake things up a bit as I needed a change of pace.
                    I went back onto freeCodeCamp and started the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Cert.
                    I got to the 28% mark and it covered most of the same things I am learning on TOP.
                    But instead I am also doing while learning each step of the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides all of the similar info, the new stuff I learned that I can think of right now are: Escape sequences in strings such as \n \\ \t \' \" and so on, and the .length function.
                    I will likely continue working through fCC for a few days or so, unless I decide to give TOP another go sooner than that.
                    Thats all from me today, bye!

                    I spent my time today going through and finishing up the w3schools docs and the mdn doc.
                    It was covering more operators / operations that can be done in the JS console / file.
                    Overall it was pretty boring but thats math for you.
                    My next task for tomorrow will be to read another article, hopefully get through it in the same day, then finally get to working on the assignment.
                    Takes awhile to read / work though these docs but we'll see their effectiveness likely soon.
                    I have nothing to visually share today or more to discuss, so thats all, chat tomorrow!

                    After being out all day driving to see my mother with my family, I got home around 8:30 had dinner and got to work on some JS arithmetic and numbers.
                    I went into explaining as best as I could what I was showing off in the JS console log for my <a href="top_proj/js-foundations/part-1-2/index.html" target="_blank">coursework document</a>.
                    I'm really tired now as it approaches almost the next day, and I was able to as much as possible.
                    Getting use to the syntax for math principles and order of operations was the main step in todays section.
                    Pretty decent, mostly review of the math concepts of course, but the syntax was the most important part.
                    Adding integers to strings and all combinations of such and their outcomes are an intuitive concept, but the oddities with adding 2 decimals together is weird.
                    <em>0.1 and 0.2 = 0.300...04</em> so strange.
                    But the simple math for it such as <em>((0.1 * 10)+(0.2 * 10)) / 10) = 0.3..0</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll be taking my leave now, with nothing of greater value to add, I shall keep it going in tomorrows post!

                    Like I mentioned yesterday, today was the day I get started with learning JavaScript.
                    I'm still on lesson 1, and I finished the first linked education material provided through TOP.
                    It was all about variables and how it works within JavaScript.
                    Explaining the differences and uses of <em>let</em> and <em>const</em>.
                    It did not touch on <em>var</em> a whole lot, but gave me the info that it is essentially <em>let</em> with some differences that are on the small side.
                    It didn't touch of what though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have not a whole lot to say on this topic, I have some experience coding in Python from around 2 years ago now.
                    So the basic premise was very similar and I feel comfortable with the concepts.
                    This was the time period when I was attending Lambda School, check Day 008 for a little more context.
                </p>

                    But anyway, I'll continue this stuff tomorrow!

                    Ok so today I went all in on the Landing Page project, started around 5pm and ended at 8:10pm.
                    I completed it by recreating the reference webpage img (into an actual page) that The Odin Project provided in this assignment.
                    Its not a 100% perfect recreation but damn am I proud to say that I did this!
                    Check it out <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/css-project-landing-page/index.html">here!</a>
                    Now I didn't really run into anything I had to look up to get this project done so I don't have much to say on the struggles, as flexbox makes everything consistent and easy enough to figure out, but only once I got use to it!
                    Tomorrow will be day 61 taking me into my first true learning experience with JavaScript!!!
                    It took 60 days to get this far with HTML and CSS and I can only imagine how much more I have to learn.
                    Can't wait to try it out!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, now that it's really late I <u>NEED</u> to go get my night started and feed myself.
                    I will talk with you about my first day of JavaScript tomorrow! See ya.

                <p>
                    Today's post is going to be as minimal as I can, as I am dealing with a lot of emotional and mental pressure from my day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finished working through the last two flexbox assignments, the first of which was making what looked like a search bar splash screen like the google homepage but styled in a "The Odin Project" kind of way.
                    After getting that one done quicker than I'd imagined I got to work on the seventh/or last assignment which proved to be much harder.
                    It entailed putting a header at the top (the easy part) a nav column to the left that went to the bottom of the page.
                    And in the main content area, six square Lorem ipsum text boxes that needed to flex with the width of the viewport.
                    Lastly a footer to rest the page on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hardest of these was getting that nav sidebar to actually touch the footer at the bottom of the page.
                    The solution proved to be the flex: 1; property attached to the container the sidebar and lorem text boxes were nested in.
                </p>

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 058:</b> <u><em>September 27th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today I worked through 5/7 of the flexbox assignments, getting stuck for quite awhile on the 5th one.
                    I got stuck because it took some reorganizing of the html code and figuring out how to organize the hierarchy or divs to meet the goal image.
                    Which was a lot harder the first few tries.
                    The first obstacle was to figure out how each part was laid out according to each other.
                    I tried a few different times to make it work, and ultimately got stuck.
                    Stuck enough to look up anything that could help guide me in the correct direction, but not give me the solution.
                    I wanted to earn this challenge fair and square.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After coming across a YouTube video where someone (who was unable to solve it) was explaining the solution (I paused as to not spoil it), I went into the comment section and found so many people in the same situation as myself.
                    With the I'm not alone in this feeling acquired I put my nose back to the proverbial grind stone and pushed on into figuring out how to solve this assignment.
                    I ended up wiping the css file back to the original code that I started out with and went from there.
                    I knew I had to make the "i" icon its own column due to the logistics of trying to center the rest of the modal.
                    And so much more thought went into how I needed to make specific divs apart of parent divs to display them in the right order... and I'll say the second I got it as close to perfect I was feeling over the moon.
                    I had accomplished this "really hard" task which TOP described as <i>simple...</i> And I would love to show it off!

                    06 and 07 have not been completed as of yet but I wanted to list them out here for visual purposes.
                    Overall I really want to keep working through this course as I find it so fun! And challenging.
                    My limiting factor is time, which always stops me before I'm ready to stop.
                    Such a bummer!
                    But I will catch up with you tomorrow and talk about how these last 2 assignments fair.

                    Today I finished reading the rest of the flexbox assignment but when I got to getting the coursework part I noticed that I never actually completed the css foundations first lesson coursework.
                    Which I was surprised by.
                    I fixed up my file organization on this blog repo and added the flexbox coursework and the missed ones from foundations.
                    I then completed the foundations projects so I wouldn't be missing anything moving forward.
                    Tomorrow I will crush the flexbox ones, and we'll see how that goes.
                    I'd bet that it'll go smoothly, the css ones sure did.

                <p>
                    Today was just me reading more mdn docs on flexbox and how they interact with justify-content and align-items / align-self.
                    And how you can use them for nav bars, with all of the different, but sort of the same, parameter values.
                    As well as use them for the card layout, where an image on one side and the text / content section on the other.
                    It was really like 80% review and 20% enlightening info reinforcing the overall teachings of flexbox.
                    I have nothing more to add other than I got more reading ahead of me tomorrow and likely If I get to them (hopefully) the practice assignments.
                    Then maybe one of the next few days will be the project for this section!
                    I'm excited!

                    Today was the start of going over the two axes in flexbox and how to swap them around.
                    And how to distribute the flex items within the flex container.
                    Using justify-content, align-items, flex-direction etc.
                    I finished up lesson #3 Axes and got through reading lesson #4 Alignment.
                    I'm still in the process of completing the assignments from this lesson and have only completed the first on before I ran out of time.
                    I'm enjoying the enlightening on this topic, and can say it is difficult to read such articles for an hour straight!
                    I have nothing more to add so I will speak with you tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 054:</b> <u><em>September 23rd 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today I went over and completed the first two lessons on CSS Flexbox, from The Odin Project.
                    I really enjoyed learning about the shorthand properties and their hidden values that clears up so much confusion I was having with flexbox before today.
                    I'm not sure how to best describe my experience with these two lessons.
                    I had absolutely no clue as to how flexbox handled its positioning of sub elements.
                    But now after reading a decent few explainer documents it's making a lot more sense, or at least I can somewhat know how to use it going forward.
                    The Max, Min and Ideal size for the shorthand property was really well explained by the provided <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex">MDN Doc</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/understanding-flex-grow-flex-shrink-and-flex-basis/">css-tricks</a> resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it's up to me to implement these new ideas into my future projects.
                    Having dynamically changing element blocks especially for a blog page like this will really make things, I think, look better and have better user navigation / useability.
                    Onto the next topic, the upcoming lesson about Axes.
                    I know nothing, and I mean it.
                    So I really am looking forward to learning how to structure flexbox items along the vertical axis, or even mix and match vertical with horizontal.
                    After which is Alignment, which is basically the same.
                    My flexbox knowledge is just starting to grow and I am excited to finally know this stuff!
                    fCC just did not do this part of CSS justice with their responsive web cert, and I can see that now!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well I hope you all had a good day, I spent the day with family going out of town for basically the whole day, which included a load of driving up until around 9:30pm when I got home.
                    I am extremely tired but also had enough energy to go through todays lessons and likely absorb a fair bit of the information.
                    Of course I need to use it and toy with it before I solidify it in my mind as a integral part of my web page building repertoire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for reading!

                <p>
                    I finished up The Box Model and completed the Block and Inline lesson w/ assignments included.
                    Meaning that I have now finished the CSS Foundations on TOP.
                    The working assignments today were to replicate a screenshot of the desired outcome with code that they provide.
                    You can see both finished outcomes here for <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/margin-and-padding/01/index.html">01</a> and <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/margin-and-padding/02/index.html">02</a>.
                    Had the harder time with 02, but easily got through it by erasing what I had putdown the first time around and starting from scratch with the basics.
                    Starting with one property and get each element to fit correctly with that one first, then move to the next and so on.
                    Finally taking a look at the "self check" section of the git repo readme and filling in the specific sizes that were listed.
                    The gaps between sections and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am starting to come around to TOP's methods but still need to dive deeper into Flexbox and then JavaScript to actually know if I'm really learning or just idly reading info that goes into the recycling bin in my head.
                    I've been feeling a little imposter'y about my abilities and if I will ever make this a profession.
                    The reading is what gets me, it's so dry and boring.
                    But maybe I just don't have the mental energy to do this after a workday.
                    Even a slightly bad day at work tanks my mood, thus draining my energy more.
                    It can be a comment from a coworker of boss, or just the fact that I feel stuck in something I want nothing to do with, that being my current job tasks.
                    I've just been dealing with the same emotions every random dice throw now and again for quite the while.
                    I've pin pointed what and who makes my current job undesirable, as when I don't have to do those things / or see those people, my day is fine and I go home in high spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About my energy when coding.
                    When I have had the energy after work to do my lessons and code, time flies by and I enjoy myself.
                    Sometimes the reading makes me more exhausted but when I do it earlier in the day this is less of an issue.
                    For instance yesterday is a great example.
                    I worked on my own page getting the nav to scale with media queries and getting my project tiles to align into a grid properly and scale their image down as the width of the viewport does.
                    I spent like 3 some odd hours working on that and 100% could have continued making little improvements to the pages.
                    I think I just need to be working with the info and not just intaking it, my threshold for that is far lower apparently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why I enjoyed, and hated, fCC so much.
                    It was all learn by doing based and even with it's issues I like that hands on approach.
                    So I'll keep it up and get as much knowledge on these topics that I can, one way or another!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know these posts are a mess of narratives but this is how it comes to me when I write them out. At least this is how I feel when I look back over it.

                    Today I started out by continuing to read the box model section but felt the urge to fix my projects page and add responsive sizing.
                    Go over to those tabs and take a look! They are now dynamically responsive, for unless you find a way they aren't... but I'm not perfect!
                    Anyway I really enjoyed problem solving this, and didn't feel tired during the process like I normally am when reading a lot of TOP's lessons.
                    It may also have to do with some caffeine I had today.
                    The start of my day was quite hectic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiple things went wrong today on the path to getting to work.
                    But I wont go into it, as they all had impermanent drawbacks.
                    But I am really happy with the projects page and my nav bar, both using media queries to resize the sections.
                    The hardest part was figuring out, through trial and error then finding the answer online, how to resize the project pictures within their parent element.
                    Object-fit was my needed property and I am so happy that it works!
                    I used my newly acquired dev tool skills to test the sizing of the page. Such a BIG HELP!
                    Now mobile viewers should be able to take a gander without the page being cut off. Hopefully.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today I spent my time working through the Inspecting HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project, where it was teaching me all about the dev tools on chrome.
                    Now I'm really tired as I ended up getting to this lesson a little later than I wanted.
                    But never the less I learned that the dev tools are super cool!
                    Allowing me to adjust the page code on the fly and a whole assortment of different tabs with metrics I 100% don't understand yet.
                    After completing that lesson I started the next one which dives into The Box Model.
                    The whole Margin, Border, Padding part of every element being selected in CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm so exhausted today it was really hard to pay attention during these lessons.
                    I hope this improves for me moving forward.
                    More sleep and tackling this earlier in my day are a must to have enough energy to actively participate and retain good information.
                    Honestly that is all I have for today, I'll see you on day 52!

                <p>
                    Happy 50 days!
                    I had do so a bunch of driving today, but that didn't stop me from getting an hour of code in tonight.
                    I completed the first CSS lesson on TOP which you can look at <a target="_blank" href="top_proj/css-foundations/01-css-methods/index.html">here</a>.
                    I know its super basic, but I'm working with the beginning of a tutorial here, and it's a lot of reading just to get through what I already know.
                    But there is one good thing from reading it, especially when I already have experience.
                    That is that I notice new things I didn't know before.
                    Such as the CSS hierarchy of selectors and how specificity take priority in the cascade.
                    I would not have known that easily without this resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I would still say that I'm not really into the learning method here.
                    I've never been much of a read a bunch of this and then wham use it and retain the info.
                    I definitely fit more into the fCC way of doing it where you learn about it, play with it, then ultimately see it do stuff.
                    And retain the information after experimenting and breaking it down.
                    I'll keep trying out TOP for until I get to my breaking point I suppose, but the reading in this way just puts me into a trance where I need to go back and read it over again after just finishing a section.
                    It's really unfortunate because I didn't really experience this level of difficult paying continuos attention on fCC's curriculum.
                    I suppose it would be my reading comprehension endurance that is the crux in this instance.

                    Well I'll cath up with you on day 51! Over the halfway mark for this challenge.
                    After which I will likely take a break from posting on twitter and <i>maybe</i> here as well but I'm not sure.
                    I really enjoy the consistency of posting and keeping a daily entry of what I had done that day.
                    In the future it might end up simply not being an everyday thing, but I don't know yet.
                    We'll find out together!

                    So I finished the HTML Foundations section.
                    Here is the <a href="top_proj/odin-recipes/index.html" target="_blank">Recipes Project</a> requested at the end of the section.
                    It was so much basic review that it wasn't very interesting.
                    I'm also noticing that I may not like the way The Odin Project goes about teaching its lessons.
                    I find myself feeling like I'm reading out of a text book and not coding nearly enough.
                    Coming from the first half of this challenge on freeCodeCamp and their method of doing it, I might prefer it.
                    I had these hopes that it would be better but currently I'm doubting that sentiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only in the regards of learning to code, nothing to do with the rest of the education I've thus far learned.
                    Learning the basics of Git, and using the CLI have truly been new experiences that I am enjoying being exposed to.
                    With freeCodeCamp the worst part of their curriculum was a few small things.
                    If you went above and beyond and made your own version of the code that solved the task at hand with personalized text and what not, it would be discarded once submitted.
                    A small gripe sure, but once that did at one point make me feel like "what the heck!".
                    The other one being their wording on some of their questions being too leading, expecting an outcome without exploring the methods to achieve said outcome.
                    Sporadically dispersed throughout their course steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it may have been "the grass is greener on the other side" all along.
                    I think what might happen is I learn both TOP and fCC at the same time, or something along those lines.
                    I know I need to see through more of TOPs lessons, as I only went through the html foundations and maybe it improves going forward into topics I have never toyed with?
                    Only trying it out will show me what is the right path for me.
                    Both resources together will likely lead to an overall great foundational understanding of not just the languages I will and am learning but the process for using them effectively with good best practices.
                    Best utilizing Git and any other means in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's it for today, I've been coding for multiple hours, a good portion of which was a lot of reading.
                    I want to be "doing" more like on fCC, the reading with no imperative need exhausts me, coming into it with some html and css experience has made the start of TOP difficult for sure.

                <p>
                    Today I went through setting up git on my coding vm, got a good introduction to using Git, and learning the basics of pushing, pulling, creating and committing through git on the CLI.
                    I don't feel there is much to say, but I feel quite familiar with what I have learned today as I have used github for this entire challenge so far and learned what I needed to know to get the tasks at hand done when it was absolutely crucial.
                    Learning it after the experience I have made the intake process feel somewhat comfortable and I would say even pleasant.
                    Learning about the history of Git and the reason it came about, how the inner workings function on a surface level of understanding opens my eyes to the vast capabilities and wonders that it offers.
                    It's just fascinating to me that the Git infrastructure exists at all and I am so excited and ready to get more into using it.
                    I think todays lessons are going to shape how I update files and commit them, before I had been working on all of my files at once.
                    Moving from HTML to CSS and changing things to get them working together at the same time.
                    Instead of that, I think the future for me will be making the changes in one document and committing it with good commit messages, and then working on the other document and doing the same thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this challenge up until this point my projects and files have not been super complicated.
                    But knowing that it will only get more and more complex as I move through this makes me realize that I need to change my way of tackling problems.
                    One commit at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a side note, I have discovered somewhat a current goal that I want to obtain.
                    I found out about this program that is hosted by Microsoft called Leap.
                    I've looked into it a bit today as I only found out about it today, and I have my dial set.
                    This is something I think I want to pursue once my skills are more up to snuff.
                    Microsoft Leap offers a paid apprenticeship at microsoft where they teach you a curriculum with an instructor for the first 4 weeks.
                    Then once completed you are assigned a Lead and a Mentor and placed into a cohort team where over the next 12 weeks you have on the job training in the chosen field.
                    I'm interested in the Software Engineer section of this apprenticeship program and I would love to get myself in there and show them what I got!
                    Once I've "got it" of course!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway my next lesson section is FINALLY the HTML Foundations!
                    Which has an eight step lesson plan layout.
                    The last of which being the HTML Project.
                    I feel this review will be the most, or I should say, the least interesting as I feel I just spent the prior 39days doing this.
                    But never the less I wont "know" until I try it out tomorrow.
                    Chat with you then!

                    I got through <a target="_blank" href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">The Unix Shell</a> today, in about 2.5hrs or so.
                    I found that narrating the paragraphs and simply talking out loud to solve the problems was a wonderful way to work through this lesson.
                    I feel I have retained the information better and I honestly feel great!
                    In the last 2 required lessons; <em>Working With Files and Directories</em>, I learned a few of the most common commands to remove, create, and move files around within the file system on CLI.
                    The <em>Pipes and Filters</em> lesson taught me about the what I'm calling "functions" and Pipes, which makes more sense than filters but I digress.
                    I learned how to use the <em>cat</em> and <em>echo</em> commands, to display a files data within CLI, cat standing for concatenate.
                    Also learned <em>sort</em>, <em>head</em>, <em>tail</em>, <em>uniq</em>, and some of their respective command options.
                    I learned how to put data output from a pipeline into a file, and rewrite it every time with a singular <em>></em> or append the output to a file with <em>>></em>.
                    Overall I really enjoyed todays learning, even if it wasn't the "meat and potatoes" of what I want to learn, I use linux often enough to need this and having it makes other things I do in my spare time less foreign than it use to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow will be all about setting up Git, and if that moves along quickly I'll hop into learning the <em>Git Basics</em> lesson on TOP (The Odin Project).
                    Nothing to show off today, no projects or anything like with freeCodeCamp but I feel accomplished.
                    Chat tomorrow!

                    Oh man was this next lesson the opposite of what I was expecting.
                    Getting into the CLI of linux and learning the bash commands for navigating directories was a load of reading and I have yet to finish the current lesson containing it!
                    There is so much more in this lesson than I expected and I'll be honest my reading comprehension and digestibility is at its cap.
                    I had also gotten interrupted a few times for way to long during this session so time kept getting later and later.
                    And I know oh so well that my performance declines around 6pm and later.
                    Did as much as I could, learned a bunch of useful info for when I get into the next few lessons.
                    And there is more to learn too!
                    Like I'm maybe 1/3rd the way through this lesson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if I'm being honest, when I start to have difficulties reading and retaining the information I switch the text over into a TTS site and play it through my headphones.
                    This seems to give me a little bit of a break and boosts my ability to keep going so if its working this well I might as well continue until I don't need to anymore.
                    If that time ever comes.
                    Side note, it feels like I have made no progress since starting TOP (The Odin Project) but I need to keep reminding myself that it's all new and a load of information.
                    I am not a robot and I cannot take in an overload of data and retain it or let alone understand the bigger picture on using it.
                    Been a little tough on that mental front, but my life at work has been better this week.
                    For what ever reason.
                    I'll chat tomorrow and finish this up! Hopefully.

                    Today was spent downloading and installing Xubuntu onto VirtualBox and getting all of the appropriate applications and updates.
                    Allowing me to start getting up and rolling with The Odin Project.
                    It took quite a long time, from downloading to installing, and getting to the point where I can actually write up this post.
                    At this point I am mentally drained and in need of doing other things.
                    Overall my experience thus far has been strange.
                    The contrast to freeCodeCamp is definitely interesting and I am not sure if I like it yet or not.
                    I'm leaning towards liking it though as its putting me in a real world situation/environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still not finished with the Prerequisites but tomorrow it should breeze by.
                    I already have Git installed which is part 7/7 of the Prerequisites section.
                    Part 6 which is up next is about command line basics and I feel that will also be quick as I have a little experience with linux command line and a general newbie amount of time using it.
                    The section after this is Git Basics, going over more info about git.
                    Which I think will be really helpful and have, hopefully, a lot of great info.
                    After that is the HTML Foundations section, which I think will be quick to finish.
                    After completing freeCodeCamp I think this section wont be hard at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway thats the next few days or so ahead of me, and I'm feeling ready to tackle it not this VM is here.
                    I guess I wont be using VS Code as often on my native windows machine.
                    Which is probably a good thing!

                    Today I read through more of the fundamentals, finishing up the Introduction section and entering the Prerequisites section.
                    Most of the info I remember from today was about ways to ask for help, the correct formats, what is helpful to the readers and user trying to assist me in debugging / solving an issue I have.
                    It surprisingly took a lot longer than I had expected.
                    But with me entering the prerequisites I now know that I will need to likely install a VM for running my Odin Projects on.
                    I have never spun up a virtual machine before, but I'm sure it'll will be easy enough, I feel as though I'm fairly capable with operating systems and such.
                    I have not talked about it here before but I do have some experience with doing this stuff.
                    More than I am interested in writing out, as it would be long winded and I'll just say this.
                    I've been building computers, game servers on linux, and in general being the tech guy of the family since my mid teens.
                    I definitely am no pro but I am use to learning new things and troubleshooting them when they don't work.
                    Or I don't understand something.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall from today I'm a little annoyed at my progress through this course as its been a lot of reading and less so doing.
                    But the next few days likely will pick up speed, possibly to much even.
                    We'll have to see.

                    Today I took a break from my website to focus on watching some reviews on The Odin Project, after which I started up their curriculum and joined their discord.
                    I didn't get super far in their fundamentals course as I'm still within the first section or so, and I will definitely do much more tomorrow.
                    They did a great job at getting the basic information I may have needed to know before getting into programming, but I've already committed to perusing this field.
                    I am thinking of possibly branching out from web development at some point and getting into either script making, plugins, or even modding video games such as minecraft by using java.
                    But I have yet to hard commit to even attempting that so web dev is where I'm at for the time being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the reviews of The Odin Project it seemed basically all positive and a great resource to get into this field in a richer way than using freeCodeCamp as of right now.
                    My thoughts on this could change in the future so we'll see how well this post ages in the long run.
                    Excited to get into the rest of the course and I'll catch up with you tomorrow!

                    I spent my time today working on the About Me page, and primarily the Projects page.
                    Which is giving me such a hard time, I'm trying to scale down my project images responsively so when the viewport shrinks the images and containing columns will do the same.
                    This is way harder than I thought and I am definitely in need of more time to work this problem out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I filled my about page with Lorem ipsum for the time being as I didn't want to spend the majority of my time working on that over actual code work.
                    I feel as though I am at the bottom of a mountain looking up the steep slope when it comes to how much I know and what I can do vs how much I need to know to do what I want to do.
                    It's quite intimidating. I think I'll either switch tasks for a bit and go to the odin project for awhile and then come back to my blog page with more education under my belt.
                    Or I'll keep chugging away at the current task at hand being the different pages.
                    I want something presentable and not ugly.
                    And I have a hard time stopping myself from working on a problem until its suitable for the time being.

                    Yesterday I was attempting to get my JS code to pull html code from html files and feed it into a section of the blog html page.
                    For some reason unknown to me I was getting 2 GitHub 404 screens on one page, one on top of the other and that was so confusing.
                    I don't know anywhere close enough to know what to do in a moment like that, so after having a panic attack I ended up reverting it all into this one html file.
                    Really disappointing because I really liked the idea of making building blocks for the site to use in many places with a simple class tag added into any of them, feeding the separate file data in.
                    But alas it bricked my repo and I will have to reattempt that at a later date.
                    Funny thing is, the setup worked perfectly on the live server plugin, so it might just be a GitHub issue.
                    Nothing more to add for today, chat tomorrow!

                    Today I spent a huge portion of my time working on this new blog page!
                    I still have lots to do, such as the About, Projects, and Contact pages linked in the navbar still need to be flushed out with their respective content.
                    I'm proud of how far I've gotten on this so far, I've used JavaScript for the first time to allow me to input html files into my index.html <em>(SPOILER The JS code broke GitHub Pages, I'm guessing)</em>.
                    I don't fully understand each part of the JavaScript file code, just enough to know it works thanks to a video tutorial I found on youtube.
                    I think the next few entries into this blog, however many that may be, will be focusing on this blog page and the development with it.
                    After which I will move on to The Odin Project.
                    Also you can access the old blog page <a target="_blank" href="blog-v1\index.html">here</a> if you were ever curious as to what it looked like before this v2.0 change
                </p>
                <p>
                    Side note, I also finally fixed the portfolio page project. I just swapped the href to the actual link, cause it was being annoying.
                    Also I need to still update Blog v2.0's Navbar to be mobile device friendly, because currently I do not think it is. <em>@media</em> queries should fix it up real quick... heh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also the name change.
                    Likely a strange thing to see on a page for someone reading this, I'm sure.
                    Like I had mentioned before I want to change my name to reflect something I chose, and that name is currently Zehd.
                    So from now on, until I Possibly change my mind in the future, this will be my name.
                    Reflected on my socials as well, once I get around to changing them :)
                    I'm just a person trying to find my own identity that is of my own choosing.
                    Thank you for reading!

                <p>
                    I spent a good 1.5hrs working on a new index.html for this blog page to become. 
                    I only got as far as making the nav bar but I think it's pretty good. 
                    With less current projects to show off I'm going to keep the new index to myself until it's mostly done, and then I am happy to show it off.
                    I may also be thinking of changing my legal name, so if you dig into the html file you will see it, lol
                    Had to look into ways to center list items vertically in the nav bar using display inline, and line-height.
                    Both super useful, and I look forward to building this page out more and more.
                    I honestly could keep working on this page for hours, but I know I need to take it slow and not burn myself out on it.
                    I've gotten 40 days in and at this point I'm feeling great!
                    I'm quickly approaching 50% of the way there, and thats crazy to think about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got to experience bug fixing today, sort of. 
                    When my portfolio page had the wrong hyperlinks to the 4 projects displayed, I had to obviously change that to reflect the project paths, but also when I did fix them I encountered a quirk.
                    Where I was using <em>\projectfolder-container\project-folder\index.html</em> it was putting the entire path 2 times into the url sneak peak when hovering over the project tiles.
                    when I tried ..\ it put <em>projectfolder-container\projectfolder-container\project-folder\index.html</em>.
                    Leading me to just have <em>.\projectfolder-container\project-folder\index.html</em> which ended up working.
                    There is conflicting info about this online so I just tried stuff out until github pushed my repo commit to the pages site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyhow, I got it working right, and now the portfolio is working properly. 
                    I had also made some small changes to spacing on the socials section but nothing of great importance. 
                    Thats all for today, Bye!

                <p>
                    Today... is a wonderful day! 
                    I completed the <a href="fcc-proj\portfolio-fp\index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> project and I think it turned out wonderful! 
                    I am excited to say that I've received my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc690c3e68-0764-41c9-892a-42ac218cf3b2/responsive-web-design">certificate</a> from freeCodeCamp's course!! 
                    But anyhow, today I focused on relearning more about flexbox and grid to get my project tiles into place, as they were just not right as of yesterday. 
                    And speaking of yesterday, for some reason the update to this page didn't get pushed to my GitHub? so it seems I am missing 1 green box out of all the others in a row. 
                    Really disappointing if this is the case, but at least I have this blog and daily twitter posts showing my completion and consistency! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cannot wait to start up on the odin project, for better or for worse I think the change of pace and style will be fun and difficult. 
                    One step at a time eh? 
                    Looking forward to it, and overhauling this website! 
                    Chat tomorrow :)

                <p>
                    After getting back from a long day on the road, going all over the place. 
                    I got home around 8:30pm and started working on my <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\portfolio-fp\Sep7Post\index.html">portfolio</a> project. 
                    During which I've hit a wall of difficulty where I just do not know how to do the layout of the project section. 
                    It is clear to me I need to get some more tutorials under my belt before I can fully tackle this problem the way I want to solve it. 
                    And after a long day like today, I am very exhausted, so I'm calling it a night. Chat tomorrow!

                <p>
                    I got started working on the <a href="fcc-proj\portfolio-fp\Sep6Post\index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> page and this is how it turned out so far, in about 2hrs. 
                    I'm honestly having such a hard time getting the essentials of placing objects around the screen and aligning them properly. 
                    I think there is plenty more I need to practice to get the hang of building sites from scratch. 
                    The navbar itself is always time consuming and difficult due to which display method should I be using? 
                    When is the right time and right way to use justify-content? 
                    How do I get an object to be centered vertically in its parent element? 
                    And so on. 
                    I've for the most part figured out how to do these things, but remembering them and having the ah-ha moment I get when, for instance, I color text, backgrounds etc. 
                    The ease that comes with those. I want that with moving stuff around. Where it all just clicks in my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll be really busy tomorrow, won't be able to code in the morning so I'm hoping I can get home at a decent time and still be able to get some time in... 
                    But alas my time for today is over and I have stuff I need to do to get ready for tomorrow! 
                    I shall update you then!

                <p>
                    I done did the thing! 
                    I completed the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\penguin\index.html">Penguin</a> project thus marking my last non-mandatory step to getting freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification! 
                    In the next project I will be building a portfolio page that has a hero section and showcases the projects I've worked on up till this point. 
                    Today was also a day I noticed my literacy with the step prompts being so much better than a few weeks ago. 
                    I can take the vague and oddly worded steps and just "guess" and it turning out correct. 
                    When thrown things I've not used or done yet before, in a prompt, I was able to assume their use of terminology and put in the correct code first try. 
                    And that really surprised me, and took me back to the first few days/weeks where it was almost a struggle dealing with the steps. 
                    And I've mentioned it many times in previous posts so I wont go into it here :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a feeling that this next project will take me a few days to crack out. 
                    I work tomorrow(tuesday) which is no problem and will give me plenty of time to work out the main parts of it, but I will be out all day on wednesday going to UCSF for a Doc Appoint. w/ my Girlfriend. 
                    So little more is needed to be said, I will be quite busy. 
                    I'm worried I wont be able to get my day in on that day but I'm hopeful that I wont be too burned out by the end of the day that I could still squeeze out something. 
                    Even just a few lines of code would be good enough for me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a side note, I really think once this portfolio project is done with, I will spend some time reworking this webpage. 
                    Possibly a full overhaul of it, organize is better, make proper stuff I have dreamed up. 
                    Things I know I can do, as this site was me trying to build something I had yet to have practice making. 
                    So with my fresher knowledge I think this page could look a great deal better than it does now. 
                    No idea how far I can take it, but I'm ecstatic to see where I can get with it.
                    Have a wonderful day, I'll catch you in tomorrows post :)

                    I got to about step 70 on today project where I am building a frozen winter scene with a penguin. 
                    There are still like 40 or so more steps to go but I could only get so far within my time frame today. 
                    Here is my progress status as of right now on the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\penguin\Sep4Post\index.html">Penguin</a> project.
                    I think it's turning out to be really cute and I'm exited to get to the end where I will make it wave at the user, which is even cuter. 
                    This is the second to last project for the responsive-web-design cert from freeCodeCamp meaning I am SO close to being done. 
                    The last project, being the last mandatory one, is building a portfolio site, not sure what that entails but I'm stoked to work on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday weekend, I'm going to spend some time with my family and maybe play a board game or two. 
                    Take care!

                    After being out driving for awhile today, and also going to see a movie. 
                    I returned home really exhausted. 
                    But I managed to get lucky and have a "quicker" project waiting for me. 
                    I completed the 29 step <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\ferris-wheel\index.html">Ferris Wheel</a> project. 
                    It introduced animation principles, such as the animation... properties, and @keyframes at-selector. 
                    I can see how these are super powerful and it looks like the next project will be using them again to make a full CSS penguin wave at the user. 
                    So I have that to look forward to. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also I would like to mention I've made it over 1/3rd the way to 100 Days! 
                    How exciting!!
                    On top of this weekend being a 3 day weekend, being that I don't work this monday!
                    Holidays whoop whoop!
                    Anyway, I don't have too much more to share with you today so I'll check back in tomorrow!

                <p>
                    Today I got home quite early as it was a really slow day at work. 
                    I was then able to tackle my mandatory coding project from freeCodeCamp at 3:15pm. 
                    I worked on it from then all the way until 8:30pm and I completed the project! 
                    I am actually really proud of this page and I think it turned out fantastic! 
                    The project was aimed at creating a product page, and with the reference page as my target to mimic I decided that making a page based on bananas as the focal point was a great idea. 
                    definitely not due to me finding a banana logo svg on a free svg repo site... totally not. 
                    With this inspiration I created a gross version of the page, witch was me figuring out how big things were and where they were on a white background. 
                    By gross I mean a bunch of colored boxes around the elements. 
                    But after I got the stuffs in the sorta right spots I prettied it up a bit and fixed up the leftover positioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This lead me to finishing it up as I was consumed by wanting this page done. 
                    I'll be traveling tomorrow and I hope I will have some time to work on the next project, which is more tutorial based rather than a serious project like todays.
                    I will say, I very much enjoyed the struggle to get the page the way I wanted, and my time dedication shows it! 
                    I've been holding off on showing you the project just yet but here it is... The <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\product-landing-page-mp\index.html">Banana</a> product page!
                    I used some free to use b-roll from a banana farm, likely from Costa Rica, but I didn't dive that deep into this. 
                    I just needed something to match the video from the <a target="_blank" href="https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/#how-it-works">reference</a> page. 
                    I would have never guessed I would make this type of a page but I really had fun. 
                    Oh and I'm WELL aware that my code is... very close to what spaghetti looks like. 
                    Always more to learn!

                    I completed the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\magazine\index.html">Magazine</a> project today, and it turned out quite nice. 
                    There was so much Grid structure and columns/rows that I'm feeling a bit more confident in their usage but still overall the info sticking in my head is probably like 20%. 
                    But it was a good introduction, and I have been wondering how columns are created in the first place for quite some time. 
                    Always wondering this when looking at different websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the next project is the 4th mandatory project, once completed marking my 80% completion of freeCodeCamp's course! 
                    Which is really exciting, as I've been talking about going on to other courses within the last 30+ days and I simply cannot wait to try other ones out! 
                    Also going over the same things, in a different order with varying complexities, really excites me. 
                    As it's the best way to really retain the information, repetition, repetition, and more repetition. 
                    But not in any boring way, it must be different in the ways that count. 
                    I cannot imagine going back over and redoing these last 32 days after completing them. 
                    That is what I mean, the sheer repetition that isn't new and refreshing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have just noticed that on every post before today I had marked each date as a __th no matter the number... talk about copy and paste to speed up this part.
                    I literally started it off with 1th and 2th... lol. 
                    I've corrected this now, but it took me way to long to realize!
                    Have a wonderful evening and I'll catch up tomorrow!

                    I cracked out just about 50% of the next project today, that being the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\magazine\Aug31Post\index.html">Magazine</a> project. 
                    The CSS grid layout and organizing the elements is definitely confusing and I'm not sure if I will learn how to use it on my own projects for the future from this project, but it has so far been a good introductory situation. 
                    In a way its like flex box in that I don't know how to use that to the fullest capabilities but I have at least used it a few times over these 31 days. 
                    Oh yeah thats right, I've done this for over a month! 
                    It's feeling more and more natural everyday I continue and I'm really enjoying that. 
                    Having it integrate with my daily life is quite the difficult change at first but now this far it, its seeming easier and easier by the day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course doing these lesson projects earlier in the day is helping, and I've noticed that I can't really do them effectively anywhere close to 7pm or later. 
                    At that point I'm just mentally drained and my cognition stops me from intaking the new information as easily.
                    Can't wait to finish this project and try my hand at making a few more projects in the future with css grids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've had an amazing thought of a program I would love to create at some point in the future, I don't want to spoil it, or make any promises but it will be based around shopping and cost effective spending. 
                    Thats all I'll say, have a good day!

                <p>
                    Today I finished up the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\city-skyline\index.html">City Skyline</a> project! 
                    I really enjoyed the end, adding in the background/sun and using a @media query to change the scene based on the width of the window. 
                    I specifically liked the part where the windows of the building were still the same color as the day time version but the building itself was dark, it gave such a night life energy to it that I just had to keep it in. 
                    So I made another @media query for a smaller screen to fit in what the tutorial wanted the outcome to be. 
                    Overall this project really put into practice nesting a lot of devs and styling them(in a basic way) to make fairly simplistic buildings, but was still rather enjoyable.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today was also another day I got to working on my coding early, and man is it night and day. 
                    Just like yesterday I found myself with enough energy and was able to enjoy working on this project. 
                    I've also started to go into work 30min later than I was, use to be 8:30 but that was my choice to go in early. 
                    So now  I think I'll go in at 9am (regular time in general) and leave at my normal leaving time, gives me some extra time in my mornings to do other things, or just be slower honestly. 
                    I don't enjoy feeling rushed in the morning, and getting enough sleep is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next upcoming project seems to be a newspaper/magazine style article with a bunch of different sections. 
                    And honestly it looks like fun, I'm looking forward to it! 
                    Talk with you in tomorrows post!

                    I got quite a bit farther in the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\city-skyline\Aug29Post\index.html">City Skyline</a> project today, getting quite a bit of styling done!  
                    Getting home early and working on it earlier allowed me to have a move energized mind ready to work on this, so I'm feeling good about that. 
                    Nothing really new being learned today other than repeating-linear-gradient() and using directions & percentages to map the color gradients the way I want them to be. 
                    I'm excited to finish this one, as I've been enjoying the aesthetics of it(without the * borders). 
                    I don't have any more time to write this blog post, so I will catch up with you tomorrow!

                    I continued on with the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\city-skyline\Aug28Post\index.html">City Skyline</a> project today and got like a third or so through it. 
                    I noticed I messed up the name of the file within the file structure so I fixed it, added the letter to the end of style. 
                    What I am learning about primarily seems to be variables and using flex box to spread div's around on screen. 
                    One section of today got me really stuck and the prompt did no helping in me solve the issue, I needed to set the background of a building segment to a linear-gradient and using two variables made prior to color the gradient. 
                    The way they word it made it quite confusing for me, but after looking online I found someone else having this same issue and the answer to that user wasn't very clear but It had me guess the correct input for the problem. 
                    I did not like that moment, but the day moves on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project I'm making a lot of divs to build up the background and foreground of the city, using :root variables to color the background buildings, first time learning about :root. 
                    I'm being shown a lot of condensing code to make it cleaner to look at, and adding notes to add to that accessibility aspect. 
                    After being this far into freeCodeCamp's projects, I'm strongly noticing that this way of learning is useful to some extent but I don't think its right for me. 
                    It's really repetitively boring and I find myself wanting to do other things. 
                    Even if building webpages and learning how to do so has its fun aspects, this particular way is not what I think I need. 
                    I'm going to do my best to get through it, and as quickly as possible move on to the next thing, see if that one is better.

                    I ended up at the end of my day after being busy for the majority of it, with no energy to push past step 7 on the next project. 
                    I am beyond exhausted and unmotivated at this very moment, but I tried my best. 
                    I think I'm getting a tad burnt and will take today as a warning to chill out, come back tomorrow and get some real good time in. 
                    This challenge is important to me, and mine to mold and to make it the way I need. 
                    Some R&R seems needed for today. 
                    I don't view this as a failed day but a great lesson in how I should pace myself and prioritize my learning earlier in the day, like I've been saying for days now! 
                    Putting it into practice is harder than imagined but I will push on.

                    I accomplished the difficult task of fixing my code! 
                    Now with that and a heavy dosage of salt I can say that this mandatory project was hard! 
                    But I needed it to be, if I made the page the easiest way that simply "met" the criteria, that would just feel lack luster. 
                    In my eyes, a great way to practice is to try and replicate, so I did, definitely not as well made as the reference but I'm proud of my newbie capabilities that got me this far! 
                    So here is my replicated <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\documentation-mp\index.html">Documentation Page</a>! 
                    This marks 60% of the course to certification done and I am one step closer to moving on to my next challenge the odin project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest difficulties I encountered today was getting my media query to work, and well, do what the reference page does, granted not exactly the same but I'm not trying to be exact. 
                    Having the same functionality is what matters to me and I got there in the end. 
                    I needed to watch some short videos and look at some documentation of media queries to figure out why mine wasn't working, and the simplest things hold back the code from working properly. 
                    Thankfully after taking a lot of time ironing out the changes in the code that I needed to make, the page now conforms comfortably with the window size. 
                    That by it self was quite the ordeal, due to overlapping css settings that I had to either rewrite with a different value to null it, or change the value to make it do what was needed. 
                    I enjoyed this project a lot. 
                    Way more "time flies" moments when I'm not following a simple do this do that tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thats it for today, I'll see you lot in tomorrows project, seems I'm going to build a city skyline like that one movie companies logo or something lol. 
                    Take care!

                    I got my tattoo today, had very little time I could spend working on my <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\documentation-mp\Aug25Post\index.html">Documentation Page</a>, but I ironed out some of the issues with it, but I still have more work to do tomorrow to get it to pass the freeCodeCamp tests.
                    I made it definitely look better, much closer to the reference page. 
                    My biggest challenges with this page so far have be putting aspects of the page into different sections, the nav bar and main section of the page being side by side being the hardest. 
                    Then needing to make the page jump anchor tags not be all wonky with weird placement but I, after looking over the reference css code, notice I had some un needed padding that was causing that to happen. 
                    Seems I add things to weird spots when I don't need to, and not put them in the spots they are more logically needed. 
                    I'll get the hang of it soon!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm really tired, and need to wash my tattoo site, and head to bed so I'll catch back up with this tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 024:</b> <u><em>August 24th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today I started and got almost all the way done on the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\documentation-mp\Aug24Post\index.html">Documentation Page Project</a>. 
                    At the beginning it was a lot of setting up the structure of the page to match the visual layout of the reference page they provide at the top of the challenge. 
                    I intentionally wanted the page to be as identical as possible due to the fact that my last mandatory project wasn't and it was way more work than I wanted to make my own themed one. 
                    Not that I don't need the practice making my own, but sourcing the material is just not what I need to spend my time doing when my time is so limited each day. 
                    Another aspect of my version of the page is that in its current state it has colors showing me the size and layout of the navbar sections. 
                    I'm currently trying to figure out how to get those border-top's to reach all the way to the left side of the screen where there are "list-style-type: none" / "list-style: none" bullet points. 
                    I don't know how to make them go away, I think it might be something with "overflow: hidden;" but I ran out of time right before I could solve that, so I'm forced to leave it to tomorrow, or the next day depending on how my tattoo session goes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relating to the documentation page, I did take some peaks at how the page was setup for its nav bar, and I had guessed prior to looking "is it a unordered list and list items?" which was the correct answer once I saw the multitude of close tabbed list elements within the inspect element feature on chrome. 
                    I had put a "h1" for the main title of the page, but when I saw the reference pages banner title being a header I swapped over to that. 
                    The consistency of using headers across the entire page for this use makes a lot of sense, so I don't know why I would want to use a h1 over a header, being almost the same element. 
                    When I get the time, I will of course remove the colors from the page, recolor the text to a dark gray, change the navbar links to not have their decorations and also make their hover, and visited, event not change any colors. 
                    I need to put a lightly blue colored box with rounded edges, which would be border-radius if I'm not mistaken, to put the "< code >< /code >" into. 
                    Spacing it out appropriately with padding I presume. 
                    Back to the navbar, it is in great need of being fixed to the webpages view but that problem is quite complex at this moment so I have yet to attack it head on to get the navbar menu to travel with the viewer up and down the page without the main sections content being put underneath the navbar, hiding crucial information needing to be viewed. 
                    At least if I want the page to be as close to the reference as possible. 
                    Again, I am trying to do that without looking at the reference code, there would be no point in any of this if I spoiled my problem solving skills by copying it line for line. 
                    I mean, I want this as a profession and I don't think I would be doing myself any favors by taking the easy way out. 
                    Not really the easy way either, as in the end I cannot solve my problems I come across thus leading to everything being the hard way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also noticed when loading up my blog-page on mobile that some stuff is broken... I'll fix that when I can! lol. 
                    That's all I got for today, take care and I'll update this tomorrow with more information as to where I'm at!

                    I got today kicked off by completing the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\piano\index.html">Piano page</a> and I really enjoyed some parts of this one! 
                    With a lot of these concepts still being super vague to me as how I would come up with them to know when to use them on my own, I found the @media part really cool. 
                    Without any guidance on how it really works(from freeCodeCamp) after looking up the documentation to it, I was, am still amazed by the simplicity and "coolness" of it. 
                    Using it to make logical statements for styling made me giggle with sheer "awwhhh" and giddy excitement. 
                    I'm not sure why learning that you can make a @media tag and make it it's own whole styling sheet blew me away but it did. 
                    Gaining actual enjoyment from learning that, which is a first in awhile. 
                    These tutorials have been a lot of do this do that, and bam it's done with no real... substance to show you the might of the cool tools!
                    I also recolored the piano page, I simply disliked the green colored piano and white background. 
                    So I made it closer to my own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now on the horizon for the next few days(if it takes that long) is the next mandatory project for the freeCodeCamp certification. 
                    I'll be building a documentation page, and just from the sound of it I think it might be a doozy. 
                    Granted I could be wrong but so far these mandatory projects have been the most fun, and the most effort. 
                    I've have the occasional non mandatory project that almost puts me to sleep because its repetitive and awfully boring, the painting ones were this for me. 
                    I've noticed since yesterday when I was working on this webpage and stylesheet, making it better organized and nicer to look at, that I really enjoy working on projects that are not tutorials. 
                    Like I feel genuine pleasure and satisfaction from playing around and trying new things to get something to work. 
                    Not always succeeding but I am still very new to this. And after the slump I was/am in over the past few days, I feel if I chase this feeling it will be a great choice for me. 
                    Now this kind of sounds like I want to not follow tutorials and what not, but thats not the case. 
                    I still need to learn and want to accomplish these learn by doing projects. 
                    And I cannot think of a better way to get use to coding often and exposing myself to new concepts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far today was a good day(minus the work section of it - lol). 
                    I'm trying to keep a good mindset that my Mom has taught me, that this[my job] is allowing me to get to where I want to be, and do what I want to do. 
                    It helps a bit to get through the large portion of my day, and I really and shifting my mentality of sitting down to code into "man I really wanna get home and code". 
                    Learning new things is never easy, and coding falls right into that basket. 
                    I put so much stress and pressure onto myself that it ends up looming over me, when I should just try and enjoy it. 
                    What rush am I in really, to make myself this stressed out.

                    I completed the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\picasso-painting\index.html">Picasso Page</a>, and honestly a lot of this project was "in one year out the other". 
                    Simply due to the fact that I had a busy past few days and this was, to me, not a super interesting project. 
                    Like the outcome is pretty ugly, but the teachings are being repetitiously imprinted into me so that's probably the best part I suppose. 
                    I feel familiar with most aspects of the code but still a little distant on how I could actively plan to use these techniques myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent earlier in the day(while at work) listening to some coding podcasts talking about how to better direct your Linkedin profile and how to network with the developer community. 
                    Gaining some great tips for making connections, that I'm sure I'll use when I'm closer to competent. 
                    On another note, I have been a certain type of typist when it comes to how I input with my keyboard, being a mixture between a index tapper and a full hand typist. 
                    I intend on practicing my typing to get better at being a more skilled typist, allowing me to be able to type without making as many mistakes(hopefully!). 
                </p>
                <p><em>Appended:</em> I updated the look of this page, and I think its nicer now :)</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Personal Section:</b> Today was really tough getting up and going into work. 
                    I constantly felt like not showing up there ever again, parts of the atmosphere there makes me super uncomfortable and the tasks themselves are not something I find any amount of pride in. 
                    I'm a sensitive person and when I feel any specific emotion it's usually very powerful. 
                    Dreading going to work, and do something I don't like, be around people who are negative and soul sucking, really hits me hard on my mental health. 
                    At this same time I'm searching and racking my head trying to figure a way out of this and a way into something I really am interested in and passionate about. 
                    But also being doubtful of myself in whatever options I lay out for myself. 
                    I think I may want to go into entrepreneurship or down a path similar to that, but again, I feel some strong imposter vibes coming my way. 
                    I'm feeling stuck, trapped, and kept in this routine by bills, and looming responsibilities. 
                    I know I will find some way, but during this finding part of that it is really bleak and depressing. 
                    A thing I think about a lot is that I don't have much of if any quality down time, I use to get that from playing video games. 
                    But now I feel all I do is watch youtube, stress about the next workday ahead of me and make myself work on my coding education(which I want to do, but having the energy is a real B sometimes).
                    <b>TL;DR:</b> Life in a recurring manor has felt gaping and baseless, devoid of true quality and sense of comfort. I'm doing my best to work through it, and I want to make it better for myself. 
                    Even with being unsure as to how to do that, I want to feel fulfilled and will try my best to get there.

                <p>
                    Today I got a bit more progress done on the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\picasso-painting\Aug21Post\index.html">Picasso Painting</a> page. 
                    Almost finishing it, but I ran out of time. 
                    It's exposing me to more CSS techniques that are more on the side of the way to do things rather than how to do them, if that makes sense. 
                    Also exposing me to symbols and different ways of moving colored objects around the screen. 
                    I'm still rather tired from yesterday so this is enough for me, on to tomorrow.

                    I just got back from being out all day on a family trip, I didn't have much time to code but I got some time in early this morning before leaving the house. 
                    I got a little bit into the next project and you can see <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\picasso-painting\Aug20Post\index.html">that here</a>. 
                    Now I am so exhausted I have no more energy to put into this blog post, I drove so much, was out all day. 
                    I feel I could collapse at any moment, so gnite! and I'll check back in tomorrow for day 21!

                <p>
                    Today I completed the <a target="_blank" href="fcc-proj\balance-sheet\index.html">Balance Sheet</a>. 
                    I have so little energy today to mentally get through this, taking short pauses every 10 steps or so. 
                    I really have been feeling burnt on this whole process up to today. 
                    Things in my day to day life have been affecting my mood and this combined with me running out of steam early today. 
                    I'll say this, I learned of some new ways to address classes, moreover why I would want to use this method. 
                    the element[class=""] is used to pick out a specific element that only contains that class and no other, while the element.classname chooses every element that has that class included, even if it has others too. 
                    Beyond that I used more attributes that move text around, and loads of other things that feel fuzzy in my head. 
                    So much information and so little energy to want to dive into understanding them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow Day 20, I am going on a family trip, it's a one day trip but I am going to be gone for quite awhile at a water park. 
                    I am extremely unsure of how I will get coding done tomorrow but at the end of the day I will still try. 
                    If push comes to shove, I may have to stop this challenge but I also might be able to do something less intense once I'm back home. 
                    We'll see.

                <p>
                    I started working on a <a href="fcc-proj\balance-sheet\Aug18Post\index.html" target="_blank">Balance Sheet</a> (not done, 50% there) page today using html tables and setting it up for screen reader help. 
                    Here are some of the elements I used today, ones I'm still new to using:
                </p>
                <p>HTML</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp" target="_blank">< table ></a>, the tag responsible for building out a table in html. Similar to any container tag, but only for tables.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_caption.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,align%20and%20place%20the%20caption." target="_blank">< caption ></a>, this tag is required to be the first in the table tag, and defines a text caption for the table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_thead.asp" target="_blank">< thead ></a> (table head), this tag is similar to the header tag, but for the table container tag.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_tbody.asp" target="_blank">< tbody ></a> (table body), this tag is in the same position as the header but replicating the body container for the table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_tr.asp" target="_blank">< tr ></a> (table row), this defines a row in an HTML table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_th.asp" target="_blank">< th ></a> (table header), this tag defines a header cell in an HTML table.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_td.asp#:~:text=The%20tag%20defines%20a,with%20the%20element)" target="_blank">< td ></a> (table data), this defines a header cell in an HTML table, essentially to a label for the column.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>CSS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>span[class~="sr-only"], using this in place of .sr-only and I'm not really sure why this way would be better.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_clip.asp" target="_blank">clip:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css3_pr_clip-path.asp" target="_blank">clip-path:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li>-webkit-clip-path: Attribute, which confuses me currently.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset" target="_blank">inset(50%)</a> value.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_overflow.asp" target="_blank">overflow:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space" target="_blank">white-space:</a> Attribute.</li>
                    <li>nowrap; value. relating to the white-space above.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I have plenty of work to do to finish this page up, and I'm getting tired. 
                    Doing this every day is tough! 
                    But the show must go on. 
                    I have not much left to mention or things I want to talk about, but I'm starting to feel like all of this information is a lot and its difficult to absorb. 
                    I never expected to be able to retain everything, and I have retained quite a good amount, but man so much information and following directions for so long makes my energy tumble. 
                    Till tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 017:</b> <u><em>August 17th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Just like I said yesterday, I completed the project! the fixes were simple and the mistakes we of my own doing. 
                    I made the project almost perfect the first time (yesterday) but my image id was <b>img</b> when it should have been <b>image</b>. 
                    And a few other issues but you can see my final version of the <a href="fcc-proj\tribute-page-mp\index.html" target="_blank">Tribute Page here</a>. 
                    Took awhile doing the research part of it, and probably not enough time to make sure the info is perfect but I'm working with what I got! 
                    The topic of choice is an activist I follow and enjoy watching their content. 
                    I also follow the same principles that they layout in their videos.
                <p>
                    But beyond that, I've been listening to a lot of podcasts relating to web developers and boot camps(I cannot attend a boot camp due to life stuff) and It makes me really want to network out and make some friends. 
                    But that is surprise, surprise, hard. 
                    I'm open to connections, talking with fresh newbie devs like myself, all the way up to devs that know their shit. 
                    Over the next couple weeks I'm going to be in a more difficult posting with coding everyday due to a new tattoo I'm getting on Day 25, so there is a good chance my progress on that day will be limited. 
                    But also from that my speed at which I type will be (I think) inhibited a little bit, due to the placement of the tattoo.
                    Once I have that tattoo, even networking will be hard, and I feel at this current stage being only 17 days in my ability to find someone to talk to who would want to talk with me will be hard. 
                    I'm not even sure what we'd talk about really... I mean obviously code and stuff but, the how is my current quandary.
                    Any how, I'm proud of this step, I've passed the 2nd mandatory project for the certificate, meaning I'm <a href="images\fCC-40percent.PNG" target="_blank">40% there!</a> 
                    Once finished I'll move on the The Odin Project, at the recommendation of Michael White Dev on YT, he's pretty cool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See you tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 016:</b> <u><em>August 16th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today was all about tackling the challenge to make a <a href="fcc-proj\tribute-page-mp\Aug16Post\index.html" target="_blank">tribute page</a>, so far I wasn't able to get it to pass freeCodeCamp's test but IMO its looking great! 
                    Now after running the code through freeCodeCamp's tester I now know what I need to work on to get it to fit their standards. 
                    I did deviate away from the simplicity of what they wanted and I'm sure some of the choices I made took the code out of the passing score. 
                    There were also a few things that weren't told to me, like putting some img caption in its own div, I made it work without doing that. 
                    But alas I will be required to do some rework and get it meeting the given standards. 
                    The project has been quite fun so far, and honestly the time flew by, I could just keep working on it longer but I'm at my time limit end! 
                    There is not much I learned today, as it's been practice and solving small problems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topic for my tribute page is on a fellow vegan who does loads of activism and content online, I look up to him and his story is quite the tale. 
                    This project made me choose something to make the page about, and I could have totally made it, something I'm able to make up for the sake of doing. 
                    But that didn't seem right to me, so I based it on something real, and someone who I don't personally know, and is not super well documented(unlike historical figures who have passed away).
                    That's all I have to share, thank you for reading. 
                    Tomorrow this page should be complete and we can get a good look at them side by side!

                <p>
                    Today after throwing on some calm ambience from a specific video game from 2011, I put my nose to the grindstone and smashed out the project I was having issues with yesterday. 
                    I just needed to suck up the fact that it is how it is, and push on! 
                    So here is the <a href="fcc-proj\building-a-quiz\index.html" target="_blank">completed version</a> of what I worked on. 
                    I completed like 40 some odd steps today, and learned about some new things that I hadn't gone over before thus far in the course. 
                    I have them sorted into two lists, one from HTML and one from CSS.     
                </p>
                <p>HTML</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_address.asp" target="_blank">< address ></a> tag, being a tag to put your site / resource address info in a footer as an example.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_accesskey.asp#:~:text=The%20accesskey%20attribute%20specifies%20a,to%20activate%2Ffocus%20an%20element.&text=However%2C%20in%20most%20browsers%20the,access%20key%20will%20be%20activated" target="_blank">accesskey=""</a> feature. allowing easy access to sections of the page based on keystrokes.</li>
                    <li>refreshing me on the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_for.asp" target="_blank">for=""</a> attribute, marking a linkage between a label and an input.</li>
                    <li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby" target="_blank">aria-labelledby=""</a> attribute which was never explained. Simply its to reference a interactive element with a identifying name for the user.</li>
                    <li>the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-role-attribute/#:~:text=The%20role%20attribute%20describes%20the,as%20screen%20readers%20or%20magnifiers.&text=Screen%20Readers%20will%20read%20this,%E2%80%9D%20instead%20of%20%E2%80%9Clink%E2%80%9D." target="_blank">role=""</a> attribute being a way to make a screen reader view a element as a specific other element/region.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>CSS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio" target="_blank">aspect-ratio:__</a> which controls the aspect ratio of the given element it is affecting.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp" target="_blank">@media</a> rule which was not really explained well, and I will probably learn more about later.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before" target="_blank">::before</a> pseudo-element selecting the first child of the given element. <em>ex. p::before.</em></li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button" target="_blank">< button ></a> element being... well a button.</li>
                    <li>And lastly just getting refreshed on using flexbox, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content" target="_blank">justify-content</a> property, which helps the browser distribute the space between objects(content) along the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_Axis" target="_blank">main-axis</a> of a flex container.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior" target="_blank">scroll-behavior</a> property which sets the type of scrolling animation(through APIs) for navigating the regions with accesskey binds or in page hyperlinks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That's just about it! 
                    Tomorrow marks a big day, or days. 
                    As it is when I start the next mandatory project for the certification. 
                    I'm excited and anxious about the difficulty of it, but never the less I am feeling ready to tackle it, with out without the knowledge that freeCodeCamp has or hasn't given me! 
                    Wish me the best!

                    Two weeks in and I'm finally getting pissed off(a little exaggerated) at freeCodeCamp's step prompts occasionally leaving out parts it wants you to put. 
                    Now I understand the whole bit of "research to figure out whats wrong" but they give a hint... and yes sure that's helpful, but you could just show me how to do that in the first place, and I'd have a reference to come back to in the future, rather than just not giving me a reason behind why something fails to their expectations. 
                    Overall their instructions are lackluster, and only sometimes when they word their "hey do this" in a specific way that doesn't give you the answer but has you figure out how to do it, then it's great, and it feels like I figured it out myself. 
                    Essentially it's holding your hand through the projects, expecting you to know the next step without showing you how to take it, and then telling you be nudging you and gesturing to themselves, showing you in very basic ways what you need/are forgetting(how can I forget if I never knew it in the first place?).
                    Also with the way they say how to do things, or actually what order to do them in. 
                    It will tell you to put this tag in, and nest this one, and add this other one. 
                    And when you do that, it errors! 
                    Tells you a not so helpful hint, and then you just look at the code, move something around and then its like yeah thats good! 
                    The great side of freeCodeCamp so far has been the project based learning, and I've learned quite a bit more than I knew before. 
                    Their execution is somewhat not fitting my style of learning but I will push on to complete all of the projects to get the certification.

                    Today I worked on the <a href="fcc-proj\building-a-quiz\Aug14Post\index.html" target="_blank">Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz project</a>. 
                    It was a difficult one for some of the mentioned issues with the teaching method stated in the above paragraph, but overall the actual code itself makes sense. 
                    Connecting labels and inputs together, adding screen reader only classes with their respective attributes that make knowing what something on the screen is without people who can see it... well seeing it. 
                    The method of a form being "Post" which I had to look up to actually know what it does, and wasn't told to add it... so the hint was the only way for me to know I needed it. 
                    I did however really like the nav bar, there are some sizing issues when scaling the page but the project isn't don't yet anyway. 
                    The style of it was really nice and I like the layout, I'm inspired for this webpage to look as nice. 
                    This was also my first exposure to using aspect-ratio:__ and I'm happy to know of it now, as well as using the max() and min() size functions in CSS. 
                    Nothing more to add to this post, so I'll finish this project up on Day 15!

                <p>
                    I finished working on the <a href="fcc-proj\typography-nutrition-label\index.html" target="_blank">Nutrition Label</a> today, after a long day of driving and being far from home. 
                    I swear I am so the kind of person that I could stay home and never leave and probably be fine. 
                    Energy wise, I'm tapped. 
                    I pushed through that though, and smashed out this project, really just getting the ideas of dividers and multiple classes affecting specific tags. 
                    I still think that's super cool and quite powerful! 
                    I still feel quite disorganized when working on these projects. 
                    More over, I feel once I am not following a guide I will find it difficult to remember everything I've done on them, and maybe fall into some bad organization? 
                    Thankfully I have the projects saved here as a piece of this blog and repository, and I can always look back at the source code to refresh myself on any specific thing I've done before. 
                    Being almost 2 weeks in its getting quite complicated. 
                    But I may only be feeling this way due to every time I start coding it's later in the day and my ability to think and comprehend becomes slower. 
                    I wish I could do this earlier in the day every day but that doesn't seem like a possibility, maybe tomorrow? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't wait to revamp this blog site with more details and style in a few weeks(best guess). 
                    Making this look super pretty-ish is the goal and it will be so nice compared to the current gray style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a complete left turn of this conversation, I've been wanting to get a tattoo for awhile now. 
                    And while out today I went and scheduled to get one of my own design in a few weeks. 
                    It's going to be put on my right forearm, and is an original design spelling out VEGAN, repping my ethical beliefs on my arm, solid black ink. 
                    I'm excited and just wanted to share. 
                    This will be my first tattoo and I can't wait to get it. 
                    Maybe once is on me I'll show it off, as the design(imo) looks very clean and nice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tomorrow marks 2 weeks, almost time for celebration! that leaves me with 86 more days! And maybe more!? 
                    Honestly I don't know but I want a career in this field so, likely ain't stopping anytime soon.

                <p>
                    I worked on the next project from freeCodeCamp, you can see my progress <a href="fcc-proj\typography-nutrition-label\Aug12Post\index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I don't have too much to say on it, besides the amazing fact that you can target specific classes and apply multiple classes to different elements! 
                    Which is super intuitive, for example a div class="thing1 thing2" and with both .thing1 {edited} and .thing2 {edited} both css attributes can be applied in one line of class="". 
                    I love this part so much, and I can see how complex it can get from here. 
                    I haven't finished the project yet, as I got to step 47, but its good for showing me how things can be nested together and how different attributes work, making things bold, float, and use the overflow properties, which still are confusing but I'll get it soon enough. 
                    Now there is not much more I really want to say, I'm going to be quite busy with real life things on day 13, but I will still get my hour of code in to keep this challenge rolling!

                <p>
                    Today was working with more CSS concepts and properties. 
                    A gripe I have with freeCodeCamp at this moment is their way of explaining things they want you to accomplish, such as "make this thing happen and have it have an [ID] of _____" then when I go and do that, and check my code it throws up a "nope, you were suppose to have a [Class=____]" and like... c'mon. 
                    but other than that I was working on <a href="fcc-proj\flex-box-photo-gallery\index.html" target="_blank">this project</a> which is a cat photo gallery made with the teachings of flex box. 
                    Now learning <em>some</em> flex box has actually filled in the part of my knowledge gap that I've had itching at the back of my mind wondering "well how do these things even stay in columns and be structured!". 
                    With this exposure I feel like I am an audience member at a magicians show who knows how the trick is performed and all the secrets behind the showmanship. 
                    Even if I don't fully yet 100% understand every part, or even remember every part moving forward(that'll take some repetitive action) I really enjoyed knowing how these containers can be... <em>flexed</em>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't have much more to go over. 
                    It's hard to be able to code for an hour or more everyday, as by the time I get to it i'm already so tired. 
                    Luckily I got out of work earlier than normal due to it being slow, and had some time to get some relaxing time in, which has been a well needed thing. 
                    Though on the other hand I honestly think as soon as I sit down at my desk when I get home I need to immediately work on it, if I don't it seems to becomes harder to do with every passing hour. 
                    I need to still be in that "work mode" mind set, as when I start relaxing it just puts me off my top game. 
                    I'm excited to get finished with the freeCodeCamp certificate, but nervous at the same time as to what I'll work on next. 
                    Perhaps once that day is upon me this webpage/site will get an overhaul, somewhat. 
                    I also need to think of some projects and in general things I could build moving forward. 
                    On top of that thought I also will be deep diving into JS at some point so that will be a whole other uphill convo to have when I arrive to that point in time.

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 010:</b> <u><em>August 10th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    So today started off with quite the funny situation. 
                    Within the first 5 minutes of working on fixing my <a href="fcc-proj/survey-form-mp/index.html" target="_blank">Survey Form</a> project I fixed it and it passed... 
                    The issues I was facing were that the top three entry fields; name, email and age, didn't have an id="___" saying what the certification required. 
                    So after adding them, I realized that the two type="radio" buttons, both Yes and No, didn't have a value="" set to them, so if the form were to work it wouldn't put and data through, I'm guessing. 
                    Anyway, like I said it took 5 minutes and I passed. Now about that project on a more personal basis. 
                    I took quite a chunk of the styles.css code(not copy and paste) from Day 8's project: <a href="fcc-proj/registration-form/index.html" target="_blank">Registration Form</a>(as reference code). 
                    Essentially I wrote down the same code in a very similar order as I knew the code worked on the previous page and I honestly only grasped "some" of what it was affecting. 
                    The actual attributes made sense, some foggier than others, but I'm still rolling with training wheels on, so coming up with the way of rebuilding something I already built seemed like way more work than just playing around with what I had already written, tweaking things here and there to see how it changed the output of the page. 
                    That process took me down the path of getting the page to how I wanted and even researching outside methods I had yet to learn through freeCodeCamp to try more of the styling that I wanted to do. 
                    The page is not perfect, even a little. 
                    But with a standard 16/9 monitor the page looks fantastic, once you squeeze the pages sides the background breaks and that was my biggest hurdle I had to move on from and just "accept" as I am limited everyday by time. 
                    Overall I'm proud of the page I built, as I wasn't expecting to make it actually look good, I was worried it would look ugly, somewhat like this blog does right now, I know I can make it better. 
                    But it's only a matter of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now since that required project only took up 5 gosh dang minutes to finish today, I got to work on the first mini project of the next batch of educational material from freeCodeCamp. 
                    This project was solely focused on teaching me the fundamentals of how html elements are boxes with layers of adjustable variables that can be places next to each other and promptly what I image as object kinetic programming. 
                    Now I could be using that term wrong, but in this case I am defining it as the use of these box models as objects that can interact with each other from either inside or next to other objects on a webpage. 
                    This explanation makes it easier to think about the use and understanding of CSS on a simple level. 
                    Connecting the logic to that of real life, too much for me to explain fully in words here, but I'm sure you understand what I mean. 
                    Now in the <a href="fcc-proj\css-box-model\index.html">Box Model</a> project it focused on building a replica of a painting from scratch. 
                    Albeit a very simple painting but something made from code rather than pixel data, being an img. 
                    Introducing me to attributes like transform: rotate(), filter: blur(), border-radius, and overflow, all while explaining the padding methods and margin methods of fitting objects into their parent div tag. 
                    I think overall the webpage is ugly yes, but useful in exposing me to new techniques and refreshing me with the same but more digestible ones. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    (<em>Very</em> Personal Section)<br>
                    (Not sure why I needed to say these things, but man I was holding this in)<br>
                    I cannot express how much I want this career change. 
                    Working on this day to day makes me realize it more and more, and I truly feel this is the correct path for me. 
                    Now I don't know if being a web developer is my final "big plan", as I could fall into anything down the line and I'm open to it as long as it has something to do with coding. 
                    I'm having a more difficult time continuing my day job, and I wish I could do this already. 
                    I know I'm not there yet but man, every day really drills it in that I want much more out of life and doing what I'm doing daily is not it. If my current employer happens to read this(as I do show him my efforts in this space, and we are a tech company. we have discussed jr web dev position possibilities etc.) I do enjoy some aspects of what I do, I understand I wasn't hired for anything other than my current position, but for me that just isn't enough for me. 
                    Now I may never get what I am working for at my current job and thats how life goes, but I will get it somewhere at some point. Everyday that goes by I am working towards that. I can't keep cleaning and pulling items for orders, its soul sucking. And honestly I hold the belief that no money value(expect for stupid amounts) can tie me to a job that I don't want to do, so my $17/hr is not nearly enough. With how inflation is going especially where I live, a livable wage is requiring a full "career change". 
                    And I really don't want to continue struggling to pay my bills.
                    I hope this doesn't come off as ungrateful, or anything close to that. 
                    To me it somewhat feels like it does, I know the difficulties of life as of now, I've been through quite a bit and I really want to be successful in my passion. 
                    I'm learning that I am really determined any time I sit down at my desk to code and work on things. 
                    The hours fly by and I don't hate a second of it. 
                    This really has become a passion. 
                    And I mean, it was one back in 2019, had I stuck to it I would be somewhere totally different in my life. 
                    I was dealing with addiction problems back then and even up to earlier this year, relating to a certain legal substance here in my state. 
                    Addiction can really be a hard thing to deal with when you don't even want it anymore but your body tells you otherwise. 
                    Where you get sick when you go without it, shivers, abdominal pain, and fevers. 
                    The anxiety from every second before I would use it, just to make the sick go away. 
                    And the pure panic when on it. 
                    All I can say now, is I'm out and my life is changing as quickly as I can make it. 
                    ALL for the better. 
                    Sorry this got heavy and seemingly unnecessary, peace and love.
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks for reading! More coding to be done tomorrow :)

                <p>
                    I have run out of time to write a thorough post here for today, but I have started and almost fully completed the 5th Project! 
                    There are only some minor tweaks needing to be made to it for it to pass the "exam" on freeCodeCamp. 
                    You can find the entry made by me for this project <a href="fcc-proj/survey-form-mp/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    I think it is wonderful, not perfect by any means but it was my best shot for the two hours I put into it. 
                    Now I really must be hasty and get off the computer before my girlfriend gets too upset, so I bid thee fair well until tomorrow where I'll complete the project and have a checkmark thingy to show off!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 008:</b> <u><em>August 8th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Hello! I worked through the 4th project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> Responsive Web Design Course. 
                    And from this section I completed this <a href="fcc-proj/registration-form/index.html" target="_blank">Registration Form</a>. 
                    It took me over and hour and twenty minutes to complete and I ran into <em>some</em> issues during my learning. 
                    It seemed like mostly poor explaining on how many of what kind of things they wanted me to do be be correct, and some other instances it was just me missing a letter/miss type. 
                    Beyond that, the outcome of this effort was quite good, as I now have a great reference source of using html forms(which was my and is still my weak spot) to make a whole page to collect user input data. 
                    Now the real fun begins, well tomorrow and moving forward at least. 
                    The 5th part of this section is the required part for obtaining the Certification from freeCodeCamp. 
                    I'll be working on and making a Survey Form, and I will have a major cheat sheet if needed(the previous form I mentioned just a line or two ago). 
                    I took a peek at it when I completed the registration form and boy is it daunting. 
                    I feel tomorrow will be tough and time consuming, and I am definitely intimidated yet excited to work on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OH! and another thing I did recently, after posting Day 7's section, I turned the repository that this site is being saved and committed to into a GitHub Pages page! 
                    So now just about anyone can take a peek at it live and see where I'm at without looking at raw code, which is for the nutty folks out there, but none the less it's really cool they provide this service. 
                    I've used it before in the past, a good... omg, just about 4 years ago or so?! 
                    Way back when I was first getting into coding and when I was enrolled @Lambda School(in Data Science)(@Bloom Institute, these days). 
                    But anyhow, I'm working hard, not too hard due to time constraints but I'm showing up everyday to bang out an hour or more, so YAY. 
                    Here's to our ever continuing uphill journey!

                    Firstly, HAPPY 1 WEEK OF CODE!!! I held myself to it, and accomplished this first goal of mine, we may <em>only</em> have 93 Days left to go through(realistically it's endless but lets not think about that right now) but this first week has been honestly a lot of fun.
                    I hit the ground much earlier today to finish up this project before I had to go out of the house and do lots of driving. 
                    Finished up the CSS Markers <a href="fcc-proj/css-color-markers/index.html" target="_blank">page</a> and learned a few more concepts behind the previously mentioned functions, rgb(), hsl() and linear-gradient() and their extra syntax specifications. 
                    Like rgba() hsla() and hex colors being used in a box-shadow. 
                    Speaking of box-shadow, all of the attributes that I have come across thus far that have these extra value placements in one line are super cool to me and I think they are going to be hard to keep track of!
                    The div displaying is still really new and a tiny bit hard to grasp but I think over time of using them more and more to design pages I'll get use to them. 
                    As well, in this project I needed to put divs next to each other and overall organizing the order of things is still confusing at this time. 
                    I just don't think I've had enough time working with them yet, but I cannot wait to be confident-ish in the use of them in the hopefully near future! 
                    The next project in front of me for the start of week 2(such a cool feeling to be this consistent) is going to be building a registration form, and honestly I really look forward to it. 
                    The whole time earlier in this challenge when I was first introduced to forms, I wondered, how could I really use them in more detail to make something useful. 
                    Now I don't think its going to be any fancy authentication or anything but still I wonder how it will be built to take input data and where it spits it out, to actually be used maybe? 
                    All I do know is I want to have more practice building things like that, and learning about how to securely and safely transfer user data and login information and such across the web. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can't wait to get started. 
                    Also I would like to shout out the amazing people and community on twitter who are all super into lifting each other up and supporting one another. 
                    It's all so motivating to be a part of this challenge and group of like minded people.  
                    So I truly thank you for reading, and or just being you!

                    I ended up working on this hour of code late into the night as my day was full of other things being done and I was just so mentally exhausted that I pushed it back further and further, I wish I had gotten it done super early in the day as I would have been able to go longer and do more. 
                    Possibly leading to better retention of learned material, as I am EXTREMELY tired now... 
                    Anyway, what I got to work doing today was the third project linked <a href="fcc-proj/css-color-markers/Aug6Post/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    While unfinished it's teaching the building blocks of digital coloring and color theory of sorts. 
                    Like the rgb() function, hsl() function, along side the near-gradient() function, working with 90deg, and color function values nested inside. I am looking forward to working more with it tomorrow to get this project finished without being so tired. 
                    And I regret being in this unfavorable mental space for this day but none the less am excited to push on and get it going tomorrow!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 005:</b> <u><em>August 5th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today was quite the day, I spent my time working with this website. 
                    Using my new fledgling skills with CSS to make a nice fancy stylesheet. currently the website looks like <a href="images/website_8-5-22.PNG" target="_blank">this</a>. 
                    I am currently very proud and I'm excited to explore what more I can do with CSS to make my site and future projects looks snazzy. 
                    I also updated the other pages on this site(as of current) to use the same stylesheet, making the blog site in total homogeneous is looks. Took me roughly a little over an hour to accomplish, with some extra work after a break in between, making it closer to 2hrs. 
                    Not much more to say for today, but tomorrow I expect to pursue the next project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. 
                    A difficult thing I'm noticing as of now is the hurdle of organizing my stylesheet and in general I feel somewhat comfortable with my html organization but I'm sure there are issues here as well. 
                    And on top of that I had a tad difficult time figuring out how to properly place all sections of the page to make it look right in its final form. 
                    For awhile I had a floating footer not at the bottom of the page, it was at the bottom of this Home page but on others it was seemingly in the middle having a swell time. 
                    I looked up a tutorial of sorts, simple code snippets conveniently from freeCodeCamp's website and got it looking the way I wanted, for the most part. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last minute change before the day ends, I added a twitter hyperlink to the nav bar, check out my tweets throughout this journey or, at least in the future!
                    Anyway I look forward to <b>Day 6</b> See you then!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 004:</b> <u><em>August 4th 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    I finished the 2nd project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and boy was it a doozie. 
                    Not difficult really, more like a lot of information and some repetitive actions. 
                    Which BTW I was liking, as to me the more you do it the more it will set in! I think? 
                    With the <a href="fcc-proj\cafe-menu\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">Cafe Menu</a> project complete I feel I have a fairly good understanding of CSS and the quickly intensification that happens with designing pages. 
                    I spent 1.283 hrs (1hr & 17minutes) working on this project, and it may seem like a long time to get that done but as you may have noticed if you've looked around in my github directory for this blog, I'm uploading the files along with completing the project on the websites code editor. 
                    No longer am I, currently, recreating the webpages by putting it side by side with a blank one. 
                    Instead I'm going the route of doing it two times, once on the website or personal editor first then immediately saving it and doing it on the other. 
                    Often times I'd complete it on freecodecamp then re-write the same code onto my own document. 
                    I was basically doing it two times, and I would even write it out on my own before entering it into the website. 
                    Confident enough to save my document before entering it in to see if it actually works, lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can see myself getting into CSS and probably being the most overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of stylization to be made, and having to get use to reading the scripts and properly understanding them at the same time. 
                    And I'm not sure how long it will take for me to look at a document of mine and just "know" what I'm looking at and what it references, I'd say this is my weak spot at this time. 
                    Something I want to get better at, and I want to build some really snazzy sites in the future. 
                    <em>I do have goals of turning this blog page into something way more... readable? and not so basic HTML ugly,</em> in due time but I wanted to throw this out there! For future me!
                    On a side-note I listen to a lot of podcasts on youtube while I'm at work, and they are all related to becoming a web dev, and boot camps and in general the experience people have at said boot camps. 
                    I feel myself falling into this world of different perspectives and options, not knowing if the path I'm choosing is the right one, or if I'm even capable of making it out to the other side. 
                    I sure hope I will, and feel if I'm not rushing anything I will make it there in due time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well anyway, today has been quite busy and not busy if that makes any sense. 
                    At work it was slow and I was trying to find things to do throughout the day, but right after getting home and taking a breather I hopped right into this project, and very much so enjoyed my time working on it. 
                    Thank you if you happen to be reading this, I know this is mostly for myself, helping to cement the concepts into my head but never the less I enjoy this current form of expression.

                <p>
                    This day had me doing a few things, my first goal was to try and focus really hard on just getting a little more experience with forms. 
                    So with that goal in mind I made what is now in the top navigation bar, my <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">Contact Page.</a> 
                    Now it doesn't really send the data anywhere but that wasn't my first idea, or even how I wanted it to end up. 
                    At first I wanted to have it setup with a functional way to send the forms data to lets say an email, but as I am not hosting this on a web server and simply just on my pc, the source I was using wouldn't work. 
                    So I opted for the more simple approach for now where it just sends you to a basic landing page, go and give it a shot if you want. 
                    Anyhow after watching videos on this process and building out my form, I went around this site and adjusted some features that were inconsistent on some pages, as well as added new ones!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which leads me right into what I worked on for the majority of my time spent today, which was around 1.5-2hrs. 
                    I went back onto <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and continued working on the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design</a></u> course. 
                    Started up the next project which was all about making a Cafe Menu page and styling it with CSS, you can check out my progress <a href="fcc-proj\cafe-menu\Aug3rdPost\cafemenu.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                    Its <b>SUPER</b> simple as of now but this is about as far as I could get with the time I had allocated today. 
                    And I was familiar with the vague layout/format of CSS, which comes from way back in 2018 when I was exploring web dev education for my first time. 
                    I use to watch a lot of a youtuber named Stefan Mischook on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StefanMischook" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>, and actually bought a course from his website to learn how to code HTML, CSS and JS. 
                    I'll say that now reflecting on that is fuzzy but the underlying "brickwork" is there as my starting foundation and I feel this wont be as difficult as it could have been if I was still a complete novice. 
                    The linking process is probably the most important part of todays journey as that was the foggy mystery I needed to relearn as I had forgotten "how does a css page even connect to this html one?". 
                    Overall with this challenge and making these posts everyday, I feel good about what I have accomplished even if I wish it was more I doubt I would be able to retain it. 
                    I know I can build more and don't get me wrong it is quite... looming to think of all the information I need to get use to, but I'm here for it! Here's to the next 97 Days!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 002:</b> <u><em>August 2nd 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    Today was quite the busy day, and to explain why will require some filler of my back story. 
                    So in my day to day life I work at a local ecommerce brick and mortar, that also does tech support for the area. 
                    I<em>(22)</em> live at home with my Brother<em>(soon to be 21)</em> and my Girlfriend<em>(20)</em>. 
                    My mother use to not so long ago live with us at our house, which is more of a townhouse apartment building, but since recent has been staying in the same town she works in day to day. 
                    Every weekend, typically saturday, I drive down to where she stays and we go shopping for her groceries and spend some time together. 
                    And roughly once every 3 weeks I drive down to pick her up and bring her to our place for the week. 
                    Well that's what I did today, that driving part, so right after work I drove down(1.5hrs) to her and picked her up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My car, which is actually her car but is a longer story and honestly TL;DR, starts having some issues and we need to take a pit stop and let it sit for a brief amount of time. 
                    We head to our predestined location, a fast food joint! 
                    And we go in to grab a snack while we wait, I had already promised my Girlfriend that I would pick her up a lemonade to bring back, my mom got some fries and a cookie to enjoy. 
                    Needless to say I left work at basically 4pm and arrived back home at 7pm. 
                    I start work everyday at 8:30am and really like to get plenty of sleep so I had to quickly make dinner and get myself upstairs onto my computer to continue the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=typeahead_click" target="_blank">#100DaysOfCode</a></b> <b><a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">Challenge!</a></b>
                    so I made this! This webpage is what I am using currently to <em>"blog"</em> about this coding challenge and where it takes me. 
                    So I've spent the past lil over an hour working on this, writing up everything I think I should put in it, and this is the result!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will continue to work on this webpage after every session to fill out what I did that day, keeping a log of each step and difficult thing I came across, and show that I can overcome them! 
                    It definitely helps that when I express difficulty with something during this challenge that I will have it logged and know what to focus more of my learning time on practicing. 
                    Thanks for reading!

                <p class="post-title"><b>Day 001:</b> <u><em>August 1st 2022:</em></u><br></p>
                <p>
                    I started on freecodecamp and entered into the <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">(New)Responsive Web Design Certification</a></u>. 
                    After completing the course in roughly an hour or longer, I cannot remember as I was "in the zone", I decided I wanted to continue practicing the new information that was fresh in my mind. 
                    I took the now finished page and loaded it onto half of my left hand monitor, one of my two total monitors, and then put a fresh .html file next to it. 
                    I used the loaded pre-made page as reference and did my very best to replicate the work onto the new .html file without just completely copying the straight up code line by line. 
                    After I got down past the first list I got stuck with the figure tag and figcaption part of the page, more so I forgot how I implemented those images with added text underneath.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then got to what for me was the most "forgotten" part of this first project. 
                    <a href="fcc-proj\cat-photo-app\CatPhotoApp.html" target="_blank">The Cat Form</a>, or in general, html forms with attributes, buttons, inputs, so many parts. 
                    I ended up peeking at the original reference page's html code to refresh my memory on what it was suppose to be. 
                    This then was leading me to remember enough parts to piece the rest of the buttons and labels together. 
                    I know looking back at it wonder in what way can I setup the part of this project myself that receives the submit field information, like where does it go? 
                    And how can I use it? 
                    Much to learn and lots to practice. 
                    I am greatly looking forward to it!
