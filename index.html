        Yesterday the 2nd I continued working on html and got through a few sections, I was limited on time but never the less got a decent bit done. I reviewed things such as &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt; and &lt;br&gt; tags, relearned about &lt;sup&gt; and &lt;sub&gt; tags, being able to just put a casual math/science notation with it. Such as this.<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup>. Then I got into learning about HTML Entities, which allows me to put &hearts; into my code without issues, even being able to type &lt; and &gt;, in my opinion has been amazing, as both the greater than and less than symbols are used semantically within html, making it difficult to write them without it affecting the code I've written. The html entities look strange in the vscode of course compared to natural language but I can get use to it due it's versatility. After that I finished up the day with the &lt;article&gt; and &lt;aside&gt; tags. Only briefly touching upon them.<br>
        <br>
        Today, the 3rd, I continued of course, and went over more stuff having to do with the &lt;article&gt; and &lt;aside&gt; tags, mostly learning that they themselves act sorta like a &lt;body&gt; tag, where I can place a &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; tag within it, even if the actual &lt;body&gt; tag has these too. Quite interested to learn, but use cases are still a little hazy, and I'll need some practice to get it committed to working memory. After this I started up on relearning about html tables, going over the assortment of tags such as; &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, &lt;thead&gt;, and &lt;tbody&gt;. Learned how to, somewhat, use &lt;th colspan=""&gt; and &lt;thead rowspan=""&gt; but again, I will need practice to get a better understanding. Thats it though, at least from what I can remember and see on my documents.

        As of a few days ago, I am starting up Colt Steele's Udemy Bootcamp, I was working on TOP's but fell off the wagon pretty early on. Felt like I wanted to try something else, something a little more structured with less reading upfront involved. This is definitely not me discrediting TOP as it has been a wonderful resource and I will likely go back to it, if, when I complete Colt's course. I'm in for a lot of time spent on this bootcamp and it will probably take me months to complete, or even a year, I don't have the faintest clue. On the note of falling off the wagon, I have been trying harder and harder to get good habits structured into my daily routine and that initially started with meal prepping, which has gone wonderfully, seems to be saving me time and money within regards to my day to day. I work night shift at my job (security) so that takes up a fair bit of my week, and when I was cooking everyday for each meal, either before or after work, it would take me hours collectively to get things done, so meal prepping shortens it down to about 2hrs that can cover 2 days, or about 1 hr a day for 3 meals per day, this also includes a set of 3 meals for my girlfriend, taking care of her needs as well. Working out has been the next consistency problem of mine that I am working on. I have an at home gym within my office (once my bedroom, now turned office) and I have been trying to get about 3-6 workouts a week. Overall seems to be going well, and I just need to keep on going! But keeping up with my learning has been tough, finding the time outside of the other 3 life things mentioned that I want to dedicate to learning is hard. Self motivating, and swapping out the idea of doing something easy or fun, for something not exactly easy and not always fun, and usually pretty difficult, has been a challenge. I feel pretty confident in my desire to pursue this career path, as I have honestly not given up on it fully even when I finished the 100 days of code, I thought to myself that yeah it was hard and I didn't know if I wanted to continue but I still felt the allure and draw to it, and have, time and time again, come back to it. <br><br>Today in particular I am working through the beginning of the bootcamp, naturally html is up first, the practice page is visible <a href="/udemy/colt-steele-bootcamp/html-section.html">here</a>.
