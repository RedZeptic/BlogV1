        <b>(11/01/23):</b><br>As of a few days ago, I am starting up Colt Steele's Udemy Bootcamp, I was working on TOP's but fell off the wagon pretty early on. Felt like I wanted to try something else, something a little more structured with less reading upfront involved. This is definitely not me discrediting TOP as it has been a wonderful resource and I will likely go back to it, if, when I complete Colt's course. I'm in for a lot of time spent on this bootcamp and it will probably take me months to complete, or even a year, I don't have the faintest clue. On the note of falling off the wagon, I have been trying harder and harder to get good habits structured into my daily routine and that initially started with meal prepping, which has gone wonderfully, seems to be saving me time and money within regards to my day to day. I work night shift at my job (security) so that takes up a fair bit of my week, and when I was cooking everyday for each meal, either before or after work, it would take me hours collectively to get things done, so meal prepping shortens it down to about 2hrs that can cover 2 days, or about 1 hr a day for 3 meals per day, this also includes a set of 3 meals for my girlfriend, taking care of her needs as well. Working out has been the next consistency problem of mine that I am working on. I have an at home gym within my office (once my bedroom, now turned office) and I have been trying to get about 3-6 workouts a week. Overall seems to be going well, and I just need to keep on going! But keeping up with my learning has been tough, finding the time outside of the other 3 life things mentioned that I want to dedicate to learning is hard. Self motivating, and swapping out the idea of doing something easy or fun, for something not exactly easy and not always fun, and usually pretty difficult, has been a challenge. I feel pretty confident in my desire to persue this career path, as I have honestly not given up on it fully even when I finished the 100 days of code, I thought to myself that yeah it was hard and I didn't know if I wanted to continue but I still felt the allure and draw to it, and have, time and time again, come back to it. Today in particular I am working through the beginning of the bootcamp, naturally html is up first, the practice page is visible <a href="/udemy/colt-steele-bootcamp/html-section.html">here</a>.
